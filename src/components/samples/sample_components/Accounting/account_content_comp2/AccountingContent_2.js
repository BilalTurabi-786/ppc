                that employee show negligence behaviour at the workplace and due
                to this reason such kind of fraud takes place.&nbsp;

                in the bank reconciliation statement and other accounting
                records. This face was concealed from the top managers. Hence,
                misunderstanding created and top managers make entire decisions
                by fully relying on the income statement, balance sheet and
                other accounting records. It can be observed that due to this
                reason firm make extravagance and there was not sufficient cash
                amount in the account. It can be said that due to this reason
                further cash amount decline in the business and firm entangled
                in the problem. This is the one of the big issue that was faced
                by the firm in its business.&nbsp;<strong>2.3</strong>&nbsp;It

                performance of the firm can be improved to great extent. Based
                on analysis of case some recommendations are made in the report.
                As part of recommendation it is clearly stated that firm must
                appoint only relevant candidate as chartered accountant at the
                workplace. By doing so it can be ensured that in proper manner
                accounting is done at the workplace.&nbsp;<strong>2.4</strong>
                &nbsp;Apart from this, there is need to improve internal control
                system at the workplace. This is very important because if there
                will be strong internal control system then in that case no one
                will be able to do fraud related activities on time. Hence, it
                can be said that there is significant importance of internal
                control system for the managers.

                extent:&nbsp;<strong>6.1.1 Poor accounting software</strong>
                &nbsp;A to Z Vehicle Hire is working with old software that is
                why cited firm is unable to prepare the records in effective
                manner. Due to poor accounting software organization is unable
                to accomplish its objectives. That is creating trouble for the
                entity and it increases monitory complexity in the business
                units. Due to this, mistakes are increasing in the firm that
                creates problem in funds management in the workplace. There are
                many competitors of A to Z Vehicle Hire company those which are
                using advanced software in the organization so that they can
                manage their records in effective manner and can prepare the
                accounting report significantly. It helps them in analyzing the
                financial performance of the firm to great extent. But as A to Z
                Vehicle Hire is not using such advanced software and working
                with poor ac counting software thus, records are not recorded in
                effective manner that creates problems in analyzing the overall
                economic performance of the entity. Due to this cited firm
                unable to make effective investment decisions soon thus,
                profitability of the entity gets hampered due to this
                weakness.&nbsp;<strong>6.1.2 Poor monitoring and review</strong>
                &nbsp;It is another weakness in A to Z Vehicle Hire company due
                to this cited firm is unable to analyses the performance of the
                organization. Due to poor monitoring and reviewing company
                cannot analyze its financial transaction in effective manner
                that creates problem in future because due to this its decision
                may be go in wrong direction thus, cited firm will not be able
                to accomplish its objective effectively. It can create burden on
                the entity because due to poor monitoring mistakes will not be
                identified thus, organization will be unable to know the current
                standards and it will not be able to resolve its issue.&nbsp;
                <strong>
                  6.1.3 Poor knowledge and experiences of staff members
                </strong>
                &nbsp;It is another major weakness of the A to Z Vehicle Hire is
                that its accounting team has not that much knowledge that are
                required for maintaining the records. They do not know about
                current revenue and tax policies; even they are not able to
                operate the new software effectively. From the case study of A
                to Z Vehicle Hire company it is found that Mo was not having any
                knowledge that whether he should register for value added tax or
                not. Due to insufficient knowledge and information they are
                unable to maintain the accounting records in effective manner as
                per the standards. That impacts negative on the organization and
                it may create complications of the entity in the future.&nbsp;
                <strong>6.1.4 Delay in preparing the quarterly accounts</strong>
                &nbsp;From the case study it is found that A to Z Vehicle Hire
                company has released the thing in the partner’s meeting that
                quarterly accounts had not still prepared. That is the biggest
                drawback in the current accounting process of cited firm. Due to
                this overall financial performance of the cited firm cannot be
                measured by the authorities on time. That is why they are unable
                to make necessary changes in the system on time that creates
                negative impact on the business performance and decreases its
                profitability. Manual wages system is ineffective and slow It is
                another weakness of the entity due to this time and costing of
                the organization gets increased. That creates financial burden
                on the entity and decreases its profitability to great extent.

            </h5>
            <p class="content-table">
              <span>
                <strong>7.2.1</strong>&nbsp;One of the main ethical principles
                is that to have professional competence and due care. But staff
                members of A to Z Vehicle Hire company was not having sufficient
                knowledge about accounting software and they are not aware with
                tax policies as well. It is the duty of company is that to
                maintain professional knowledge and increase level of skills of
                its workers those who are working in the accounting department.
                But employees of cited firm were not having knowledge and
                experience of accounting software and current standards. That is
                breach of ethical principle which is not acceptable in the
                organizations.&nbsp;<strong>7.2.2</strong>&nbsp;Confidentiality
                is the major ethical principal which is necessary to maintain by
                the corporation. In A to Z Vehicle Hire company employees were
                misusing the internet which was illegal and unethical. Access of
                unauthorized website is not ethical and it is consider as breach
                of law under the accounting system. There is risk that people
                can pass the confidential detail of the company to others which
                can create trouble for the organization. There were many people
                those who are doing the same that is breach of law and against
                the ethical principle.&nbsp;<strong>7.2.3</strong>&nbsp;It is
                necessary for the organization that to maintain integrity in the
                accounting system. It was found that Peter has told the Chandra
                that to use the last year account and increase figures. They
                have increased 80% gross income and have makes changes in net
                profit as well. It was fraud and unethical. Changes in
                management accounts in order to show more profit is completely
                wrong and this is termed as breach of integrity. That can cause
                trouble to the entity if bank trap the fraud that can harm the
                brand reputation and it may be possible that bank will not grant
                loans to the organization.&nbsp;<strong>7.2.4</strong>
                &nbsp;Professional behavior is another major ethical principle
                which was breached in A to Z Vehicle Hire company. It was
                noticed that staff are not taking their responsibilities
                seriously and they have not prepared quarterly accounts on time.
                This is wrong attitude and it is not professional behavior. Due
                to this cited firm fails to measures its performance and it
                cannot take action for increasing its profitability.

              <span>
                <strong>7.3.1</strong>&nbsp;To resolve the professional ethical
                issues, organization needs to hire all those persons which are
                highly qualified and skilled so that they can easily understand
                the software system easily. Workers who are working in an
                accounting departments should be trained so that by using their
                specific knowledge they can easily understand all the accounting
                activities in an organization. Organization also gives the
                guidance about the accounting standards and code of ethics so
                that employees working level will also increases.&nbsp;
                <strong>7.3.2</strong>&nbsp;To make confidential workings in an
                organization also help to increase the level of organization
                (Stewart and Subramaniam, 2010). Firm need to banned the
                unauthorized use of sites and reduce the misuse of internet by
                using CCTV camera etc. By managing the behavior of professionals
                and make effective relationship between employees and seniors,
                helps to resolve the professional ethical issues. Company should
                try to organize learning programs through lectures, case
                study.&nbsp;<strong>7.3.3</strong>&nbsp;These activities help to
                build an effective relationship with the professional in an
                organization. Organization also set up code of ethics and
                violating the code so that all the issue is reported to the head
                of the department. Firm also need to prepare appropriate
                documentation which consists of the nature of the work and also
                help to reduce the risk/ liability for the organization.
                Professionals also examine the workers and educate them by
                certification process and professional learning as per the
                per-determined code of ethic (Bebbington, Unerman and O’Dwyer,
                2014). Hence, by using the ethical code of conducts all the
                professionals’ ethic issues can be solved effectively in an
                organization.

                dis-satisfaction among the employee and organisation if salary

                of employee and they will work effectively and efficiently
                (Evans, 2013). There are some reason which causes problems like
                using the incorrect deduction amounts, not classify the
                employees correctly, and overtime rules, no changes and no
                increment in payroll.&nbsp;<strong>8.1.2</strong>

                if employee is working overtime, they should be paid extra wages
                (Taylor and Curtis, 2010). Employee’s classification can be done
                properly to identify the work or each person and provide wages

                Cited case situation clearly entails that, with the motive to
                fulfill the requirements of banking institution personnel of A
                to Z showed 80% more income and 60% incline in net profit
                margin. Financial institution is one of the main stakeholders
                that require quarterly accounts for evaluating the financial
                position as well as aspects of business unit. Hence, due to the
                delay in the preparation of accounts Chandra increased figures
                in the latest quarter’s report. Such aspect comes under the
                category of fraudulent practices because inappropriate accounts
                presented by A to Z to the banking institution. In addition to
                this, one of the personnel failed to complete BRS with the high
                level of accuracy. Due to this, such personnel altered cash book
                that shows more error in such respective account. In addition to
                this, due to the fraudulent activities or practices cash flow
                problems occurred in A to Z. Moreover, when business unit
                started to make repayment to the customers then it may result

                It is recommended to A to Z to conduct internal audit or
                assessment of accounts on periodical basis. Hence, by evaluating

                <strong>11.1</strong>&nbsp;Security of accounting records and
                use of ineffectual accounting software&nbsp;
                <strong>11.1.1</strong>&nbsp;Cited case situation shows that in
                the business unit unacceptable use of internet increased to the
                significant level as compared to the prior times. From the
                analysis of case situation it has been assessed that employees
                are spending their huge amount of time in sending discriminatory
                messages to others. In addition to this, employees also post
                anything on internet which in turn places direct impact on the
                image of business unit. Further, it has been found that
                personnel are involved in sharing confidential information to
                others. In A to Z alteration practices in the cash book also
                inclined to a great extent. Hence, it is recommended to make use
                of highly effectual software or system such as My SQL. This
                system will impose following cost and offers below mentioned
                benefits to the firm such as:&nbsp;
                <strong>11.1.2 Cost analysis:</strong>For operating My SQL A to
                Z requires highly competent and skilled personnel. Moreover, My
                SQL is based on programming language so every personnel do not
                have ability to operate the same in an effectual way. Thus, firm
                is required to organize training for developing familiarity
                among the individuals about the advanced features of MY SQL.
                Moreover, without having proper knowledge about MY SQL personnel
                would not become able to deal with the same more efficiently. In
                this, requirements in relation to training aspect impose cost in
                front of firm and there by affects financial aspects of firm.
                Besides this, individuals within the firm also have to devote
                their time in the training aspects which in turn closely
                influences their productivity aspect. Hence, all such aspects
                clearly show that My SQL system has significant cost to the
                firm. However, cost level is less in against to the benefits
                which will be offered by MY SQL.&nbsp;
                <strong>11.1.3 Benefit analysis:</strong>&nbsp;Adoption of
                software such as My SQL will offer several benefits to A to Z
                which in turn directly makes contribution in the attainment of
                organizational goals and objectives. Moreover, for operating My
                SQL there is no requirement of internet connection which is one
                the main effectual aspect of it. Moreover, one of the main
                issues within A to Z is that employees are making misuse of
                internet services. Thus, use of MY SQL will overcome the issue
                in relation to misuse of internet to a great extent. In addition
                to this, MY SQL software offers high level security to the
                business unit because such cannot be accessed by unauthorized
                individual. Thus, MY SQL will reduce undesirable accounting and
                hacking related practices to the significant level.&nbsp;
