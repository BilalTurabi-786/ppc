                Business organization now a days focuses on the packaging and
                labelling of the products so that they can attract number of
                customers towards companies services. The food industry pack the
                items so that they can protect them from the external
                environment. Packaging is a factor through which the enterprise
                can advertise and promote their products. Further, they will be
                able to create a strong base of customers and they can also earn
                profits in the market. If packaging is proper then people will
                be able to know about the information of goods. The present
                report is based on HP Food Limited which perform its operations
                in food industry. They focuses on the packaging of their
                products (Robertson, 2016). The below mentioned report is based
                on the packaging of the products that help the firm in order to
                achieve their objectives. Along with this, it also explains that
                how these factors may influence the evaluation test.
                Furthermore, it also explains that how decisions can be
                evaluated and test can be used by an enterprise.

                The demand of the packaged food is increasing in the market and
                through this companies global image is also get improved
                (Mahalik and Nambiar, 2010). Along with the income of people
                their need for packaged good is also increased. Now people are
                conscious for their health so they prefer to buy goods that have
                proper packaging because through this they will be able save
                their health from the outside world. Now packaging of the
                commodities is different from the last 20 to 30 years at that
                time people are not that much conscious for their health. In the
                past years, the scope of the internet is not wide so companies
                will not be able to offer their services at global level. So,
                they don’t focus on the packaging (Duncan, 2011).

                HP Food Limited can use some of the packaging materials in order
                to pack the products so that overall goals can be accomplished.
                The right kind of material and technology can improve the brand
                image of the firm because through this quality of the products
                can be maintained. Some of these material are glass, metal,
                plastics, paper and paper board (Hawkes, 2010). By using these
                stuff, a retail industry pack the products so that safety of the
                food can be increased. The manager can also conduct a research
                in the market so that they will be able to identify the factors
                that may affect the packaging of the food (The functions of
                packaging.2011).

            <p>
              <span>
                The packaging of the products is important for the food industry
                because through this they will be able to protect the goods
                (Silvestre, Duraccio and Cimmino, 2011). If packaging is good
                then its quality can be maintained for a longer period and along
                this their safety can be ensured. Through this, the industry can
                protect the food item from the chemical and biological factors.
                Along with this, this will also reduce the wastage of food items
                in the&nbsp;environment&nbsp;and it save the good from the
                environmental factors. It will increase the convenience for the
                users and it minimize the efforts of the customers. Innovative
                packaging can increase the sales in the market and through this
                consumers will be able to know about the features of the
                products.

                HP Food Limited has to pack their items on the basis of the type
                of food so that their freshness can be retained for a long time
                (Yam and Lee, 2012). There are some items like vegetables, high
                fat content products and high moisture products. The packaging
                of these items are difficult for the food industry because they
                have to attract more consumers by providing them healthy and
                safe products. Through these, they will be able to improve their
                global business in an efficient manner.

                UHT milk is the most common product that is consumed by the
                people of United Kingdom. For this, the firm use pasteurized
                process so that quality of the product can be ensured and for
                its packaging the food industry uses tetra pak shelf safe carton
                (Siracusa, 2012). Some of the layers of this product are the
                first layer of this product seals in the liquid, adhesion layer,
                aluminium foil, paper and last it covered in the top layer. The
                purpose of this type of packaging is to provide the safe and
                healthy products to the customers. Through this, transportation
                of the heavy products can be easy for the food industry.

                The packaging of products is an important tool that is used by
                the food industry so that they can save their goods from the
                environmental changes, pollution, manufacturing date and expiry
                date. These organization can use MAP(modified atmosphere
                packaging) technique so that products can be preserved for a
                long time. In this technique, the firm insert the gases such as
                oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen in order to preserve the
                products (Kirwan and Strawbridge, 2011). On the basis of this
                the company can offer fresh and safe food items to the people of
                the country for a long period.

                There are three types of packaging of the products with proper
                labelling so that customers will be able to know about the
                product information. The first one is showing the packaging of
                the products in cane and its outer layer is made by the metal.
                The another product is showing the packing of the products in a
                plastic wrapper on which all the information is given about the
                product. In the last product the product is packed in a glass
                bottle with the proper information. Through these packaging the
                food can be preserved.

                In MAP technology, the firm uses the different gases such as
                oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in order to preserve the
                product for a long time. When these gases get mixed with each
                other then they only they can preserve the goods for their
                customers. Along with this, this mixture is depend upon the type
                of product and their packaging (Food Packaging Materials.2017).
                Through these chemicals product can be preserved for a long
                duration (Mihindukulasuriya and Lim, 2014). Furthermore, on its
                packaging the firm can provide the information regarding to the
                products its manufacturing and expiry date.

                The food industry can use field packing, shed packing and
                repacking in order to provide the products through the world.
                These packaging should be used by the organization so that food
                items can be protected from the virus, bacteria and listeria. If
                food products are in the contact of the environment than through
                the environmental factors these pathogens can be grow in the
                products (Raheem, 2013). The freshness of the product can be
                identified by the sensory organs.

                companies will be able to increase their profits and decrease
                the cost. On the basis of some factors the food industry will be
