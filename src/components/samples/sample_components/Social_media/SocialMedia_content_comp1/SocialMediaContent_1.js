            <p>

                According to the Hudson Matthew, (2018) Social media is defines
                as websites and applications that are created to provide peoples
                a platform to share content efficiently, quickly and in real
                time. As per the view point of , social media plays an essential
                role in defining about what we think about, how we observe
                things and discussion about various issues prevailing in
                society. Further they quoted that social media influence the
                various aspects of society i.e. cultural, social, spiritual,
                political, economical and religious. Apart from this social
                media also have a great impact over the thinking level of a
                person, their feeling and reaction over particular issues.
                According to the Goh, Heng and Lin, (2013) social media is a way
                to share information and also created the demand for marketers
                to market their product online to communicate with large number
                of people within relatively less time and cost. Hence, social
                media marketing have a positive impact over the growth of
                company by increasing its volume of sale through broadening its
                market base. But as per the view point of Naylor, Lamberton and
                West, (2012) Social media plays both positive as well as
                negative role in marketing of product or services. As customer
                who uses social media site for purchasing their product or
                services, generally make up their decision on the bases of
                reviews from experienced consumers. So, negative reviews from
                other customers may affect the brand image of company and also
                influence the choice of visitors.

            <h5>
              <span>Factors that affect the consumers’ purchases</span>
            </h5>
            <p>
              <span>
                According to Alton Larry, (2016) customers choose one product
                over another after weighing a variety of factors which are
                divided into two categories i.e. product or non product factors.
                The product factors directly related with the features,
                benefits, quality or quantity that a particular product poses.
                On the other hand non product factors include brand name,
                product placement, packaging, pricing and reputation of that
                product. So, Mark &amp; Spencer must predict the buying
                behaviour of consumer on the bases of these factors before
                marketing or positioning their product in market.
