                Communication is an integral part of our day-to -day life which
                not only help us to share or transmit knowledge, but also help
                us to contextually relate to other human beings. Human beings
                use several forms of verbal or non-verbal communication to
                express numerous emotions.&nbsp; Robust communication skills are
                required for a harmonious personal life as well as a successful
                professional life. Though, strong communications skills can help
                an individual to excel in any profession, but these prove to be
                a pivotal set of skills for some professionalsviz. healthcare or
                nursing.&nbsp; Among all the healthcare professionals, nurses
                are the only team member who interact with almost all
                stakeholders of the healthcare team. Through effective
                communications nurses bridge the gap between patients and
                doctors(physicians). Nurses are anticipated to judge the
                situation and use apt set of&nbsp;communication&nbsp;framework
                while having staff to staff interactions across disciplines,
                units or hospitals; staff to patient communication; and staff to
                family/carer/advocate communication

                The present paper deliberates one such important communication
                framework i.e. assertive communication which is used during
                nursing communications. The paper uses a hypothetical scenario
                as an example to explain the basic concept, strength and
                limitations, and application strategies of assertive
                communication in nursing. The paper also critically analyses the
                necessity of using assertive communication in the chosen
                scenario.

                Assertiveness is the ability to express one’s feelings,
                opinions, beliefs, and needs directly, openly and honestly,
                while not violating the personal rights of others (Ellis &amp;
                Hartley, 2005). Traditionally, it was believed that a nurse
                should be acquiescent and submissive while communicating with
                the doctors/ patients/ family/caregiver (Slater 1990; Poroch
                &amp; McIntosh 1995). But, over the period of a paradigm shift
                has been observed in nature of nursing profession, healthcare
                laws, and legal rights of nurses (particularly female). These
                changes in the healthcare scenario compel the nurses to explore
                other sets/ frameworks of communication, assertive communication
                being one of them. Being assertive doesn’t imply to be
                aggressive or rude while communicating. Rather it means to voice
                your opinion in a positive way by staying calm and standing for
                your or other people’s right. Though in some people
                assertiveness comes naturally, yet some need to learn it by
                practice and application. There are basically two model which
                can be applied for practicing assertive communication in
                nursing. First one is “See it, Say it, Fix it”, this implies to
                looking into the situation and critically analysing it, thinking
                analytically about what should be communicated and saying it,
                and working together with the other person to resolve or fix
                it.&nbsp; Another model used for applying assertive
                communication is&nbsp; a descriptive version of three-step model
                explained earlier and is known as the “Five-step model”. This
                model uses a five-step approach to resolve the problem and
                effectively communicating the message: getting other person’s
                attention, expressing concern, being direct and unambiguous
                while communicating, stating the problem and explanation (if
                required), proposing a plan of action, and reaching to the right
                decision by positive discussion.

              <span>
                For example, in the chosen hypothetical scenario, a nurse was
                advised by the team members to communicate with the
                family/friends of a young man who is brought to hospital
                unconscious with serious head injuries. The nurse is supposed to
                inform the family that the patient is unconscious and needs to
                be shifted to intensive care unit for further management.
                However, the family responded aggressively for the delay in
                information and invaded the personal space of the nurse by
                poking on shoulder. In current scenario, being passive and
                accepting the aggressive behaviour of the family members could
                create a havoc situation which could negatively affect the
                self-esteem of the nurse.&nbsp; As quoted by George Bernard Shaw
                “the greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it
                has been accomplished.”&nbsp; Being passive in such scenario
                might give an impression of having empathy with the family
                members, but it could give a wrong message of negligence on part
                of hospital and healthcare team. Passiveness or lack of
                assertive communication skills in nurse are often picked up as
                inferiority complex (O’Mara 1995). However, assertive
                communication in such scenario reflects a direct, open and
                honest explanation, which clarifies one’s needs to the other
                person. Hence, in such scenario an assertive framework of
                communication is required.Burnard (1992), also stated that
                assertiveness depicts professional confidence among nursing
                professionals and should be encouraged.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                In the current scenario, it is recommended that a nurse should
                apply a five-step model of assertive communication framework.
                Direct and clear communication is one of the important element
                of assertive communication. It is important that the nurse stay
                direct in the communication with the family members of the
                patient. It is necessary that the nurse call them by their name
                (if not known, may ask first whom he/she is speaking too). This
                generate a feeling of acquaintance with the family, and gives an
                impression that nurse is well-acquainted about the patient.
                Using indirect ways to address gives an impression of lack of
                knowledge about the patient. Second important thing is
                maintaining the eye-contact while talking with the family. This
                shows confidence in the communication. Choice of words is
                another important aspect. The message delivered to the family
                should be clear and precise in a language understandable to
                them. Try not to use too much medical vocabulary or jargons, as
                these might create confusion in the family members. It is also
                required that a nurse explain the further plan of management,
                why it is required for the patient, and how the healthcare team
                will execute it to the family. A nurse should always ask for a
                feedback once the explanation/ information is provided to the
                family.&nbsp; This reduces the chances of misinterpretation.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                The second element of assertive communication is being
                apologetic about any delays or inconvenience caused by
                healthcare team or their counterparts.&nbsp; As described in the
                scenario chosen, the family is already furious about delay in
                information about their patient. So, in such case it is
                necessary that the nurse empathise with their situation and
                provide them legit explanation about why the information was
                provided late to them. It is advised that a nurse should not
                built up any lame stories to cover up the mistakes by the
                healthcare team in delaying the information to the family.
                Rather, in such case it is required that a nurse accept the
                fault on the counterpart and give a genuine explanation the
                delay.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                The third most important element in assertive communication
                framework is to understand the rights and voice your opinion. It
                is necessary for a nurse to understand that being accepting and
                subservient is not part of the job responsibility. It is
                required that a nurse should stand for his/her self-respect and
                self-esteem. Invasion of personal space, even though by a grief
                stuck family members should not be accepted. As described in the
                hypothetical situation, the family member invaded the personal
                space by poking on the shoulder. Hence, under such situation,
                the nurse should express the uneasiness caused in a firm voice,
                explain that such gestures are unacceptable, and if require warn
                the family member of strict action if this kind of behaviour is
                repeated. Even though, such communication is required in such
                situation, yet most of the nurses refrain from using assertive
                communication. As concluded by Valentine (1995), nurses believe
                that they are expected to resolve a conflict by caring and
                interpersonal obligation rather by voicing their rights.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                It is required that the nurses understand that assertiveness is
                ability to express one’s feelings, opinions, beliefs, and needs
                directly, openly and honestly, while not violating the personal
                rights of others. As seen in the hypothetical scenario used it
                is need of the situation to be assertive. By openly expressing
                the discomfort against invasion of personal space and honestly
                explaining the cause of delay in providing the information about
                the patient to the family members should not be considered as
                aggressive behaviour. Rather, clarity and straight-forwardness
                in the communication will help the nurse in developing strong
                interpersonal relations with the family members. Peplau, 1997
                also stated that interpersonal relations are important in
                nursing.Establishing a trusting interpersonal relationship
                allows nurses to make suggestions, communicate openly with
                patients and family members and be assertive in the patient
                care.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                Another important aspect of communication in this scenario is
                the clarity of the communication. Family members of the patient
                who are not well-informed often develop anger against the
                healthcare staff anticipating negligence on their part. Hence,
                it is important that a nurse bring out a clear communication
                with the family member. A nurse should clearly explain the
                events as they have happened once the patient has been admitted
                to the hospital. The exact procedures which are carried out and
                their relevance for interest of patient health. It is also
                necessary that the nurse have a clarity while briefing the next
                steps which are planned for the patient and hoe they will be
                executed. A clear explanation from nurse will help the family
                member to gain confidence in the healthcare team and the
                management strategies planned for their patient. It is also
                vital to gain consent from them regarding medical procedures.

                Nurses are a very resourceful member of the health care team,
                they are efficient in drawing variety of physical and
                psychological intervention that facilitates management of the
                patients and provide empathy to the care providers. However, it
                has been observed that nurses are often typecast in terms of
                their behaviour and communication, and are anticipated to
                communicate in a defined. With changes in time and trends of
                healthcare and expansion of job responsibilities of the nurses,
                it is required that nurses understand the requirement of
                different sets of communication skills like assertive
                communication. It is necessary that the nurses understand that
                being assertive boosts their communication skills and help them
                to grow as a professional. Various nursing literature have
                repeatedly called for teaching assertive communication skills to
                the nursing students as part of early learning, as well
                encourage them to practice by role play or in real life
                situations.&nbsp; It is required that all nursing professional
                should understand that being assertive is not equivalent to
                being aggressive, rather it is a sign of self-confidence,
                believing in your work, and standing for your opinion.

            <p>
              <span>
                From this report, it can be concluded that communication play
                vital role in order to develop trust and confidence within the
                patient and their family members. In accordance with the case, a
                patient was bought to the hospital with head injury and got
                unconscious. Their family members where waiting for long time in
                the waiting room. They are really upset for not providing them
                proper information regarding what had happened to the patient.
                As per the situation, it is important to have assertive
                communication that will enable to convey the information.
                Further, there are two models for practising assertive
                communication. Among the two, five steps model is taken into
                consideration. Further, it is essential to have proper eye
                contact and to deliver information by stating their name. This
                is helpful in conveying the information and to make their
                situation under control.

                level of importance which ensures high level transparency and
                standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final
                accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly
                reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making
                decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical
                knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting
                Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting
                personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and
                liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance,
                other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By
                taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel
                can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this,
                in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred
                tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to
                another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update
                with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager
                and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable
                tax liability.&nbsp;In addition to this, IAS 26 serves
                information about retirement plans which can be distinguished
                into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan.
                Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording,
                measurement and disclosure of information regarding the
                retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation
                accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and
                regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells,
                2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that
                technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for
                dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently.
                Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is
                highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail,
                Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has
                different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in
                against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is
                highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement
                benefits and deferred tax amount.&nbsp;There are several key
                issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated
                below:

                  Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the
                  regulations which business entity requires following for
                  ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However,
                  sometimes is not possible for the business organization to
                  comply with all the rules to the large extent.

                  Further, some government authorities have framed and
                  introduced legislation which entail that companies are not
                  obliged to prepare financial statements according to
                  accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives
                  also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow
                  for the preparation of financial statements.
