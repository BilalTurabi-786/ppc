                Social policy refers to a mechanism that combines economics,
                politics and sociology in order to examine that how UK
                government is addressing social issues for ensuring justice and
                public welfare. It consists of various rules, regulations and
                statutory principles that government uses for welfare and
                protection of the society. The present project report emphasizes
                upon various kinds of social policies and regulations applied in
                UK i.e. Poor Law Act, 1834, Welfare state and New Labour Social
                Policy for examining the mandatory governing principles to
                ensure public safety and well-being

            <h4>
              <span>1. Importance of 1834 Poor Law in social policy</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span>
                In 1834, UK Parliament has introduced several amendments in Poor
                Law 1601, called Poor Law Amendment Act 1837 or New Poor Law.
                The amendments were introduced considering three principles,
                Malthus, Ricardo’s iron law of wages and Bentham’s principle
                that people demand relief rather than working somewhere. The
                legislation plays an important role in the social policy because
                after such amendments, people believe that the reform will
                reduce the cost of looking to the poor because they would have
                stopped the outflow of money to the poor except only in special
                circumstances. Now, after the reform in 1834, people have to go
                to the workstations where they are provided with the cloth, food
                and shelter facilities in exchange for the labor work performed.
                They are abided by the strict principles, rules and regulations
                and live in terrible conditions. The law encourages and
                motivates poor people in the society for working hard to help
                themselves and take beggars out off the street. It has two
                priorities stated as moving of people to the urban areas, towns,
                cities where individual can found employment opportunities and
                protecting urban payers from the excessive wages demand of
                migrant people before getting a full-time employment.

                Many individuals react positively to such reforms i.e. Duke of
                Wellington and Poor law Commissioner named James
                Kay-Shuttleworth supported the act as they believed that
                majority of the population were poor just because of their own
                foolishness. They said that industrial revolution has led too
                many changes i.e. rapid growth of population, rising rate of
                unemployment and others, which in turn, increases number of poor
                in the country. Thus, these amendments are based on the
                principle of less eligibility and workhouse test will have a
                serious impact on the poverty in UK. The act was issued on the
                belief that granting financial assistance, pensions and other
                benefits can result in serious consequences; thus, poverty is
                seen as a misfortune and pays focus on improvement of poverty
                and employment rate so as to make poor people free from the
                poverty. However, on the other hand, Richard Oastler has argued
                that new law is cruel by calling workhouses as prisoners for the
                poor people as they are not maintained in well condition. In
                response to it, the government has introduced a system of
                regular inspection of the workhouses. Although the act was
                issued with the view to reduce poverty; still, its importance is
                declining with the coming of welfare states in the nation

              <span>2. Progress of social policy between 1900 and 1914</span>

                In 1900, UK government has estimated that nearly 30% of the
                population were living at the edge of starvation where they were
                suffering various issues due to lack of food availability. At
                the same time, there were high level of income and wealth
                inequality that were noticed by the government, as a result,
                during the period of 1906-1914, a number of liberal social
                reforms have been introduced by the British liberal party that
                was elected in 1906. It comprises free meals to the children in
                school in 1906, medical check-ups of pupils in 1907,
                compensation to workers for suffering from injuries at the
                workplace in 1906, Old-Age Pension Act in 1908 wherein all the
                pensioners were provided with the extra pension of 5 shillings,
                introduction of National Insurance Act in 1911 to provide
                insurance facilities to all the employees from sickness by
                paying a weekly premium of four penny and unemployment benefits
                were also brought in certain specific industries such as
                shipbuilding.

                Despite this, under the social reform, British party had charged
                high rate of taxes on the rich people so as to collect funds and
                spent it on the poor, in order to provide better facilities and
                improving conditions of the poorer people in the society. . In
                1909, labour exchange was also introduced to provide help to the
                unemployed people who are looking for the job by providing them
                a platform where they can apply for the job in interested field.
                Apart from this, in 1912, clinics were established in school to
                diagnose health concerns and illness of the children. In 1914,
                local authorities were also provided with the government grants
                to deliver maternal and welfare facilities to the child.
