                ethics by making them honest and true towards various aspects of
                life. In addition to this, every person has their own culture

                facilitate to motivate elderly people for saving natural
                resources which is practically a very good aspect. Meanwhile,
                religion can be known as an organised, community based system of
                beliefs that impacts positively on mental health condition of
                elderly people. Laura Greenstein (2019) states that it is
                favourable for individuals because it is responsible for
                providing a sense of culture and typically offers a group of
                people to connect with over same thoughts &amp; value. In
                addition to this, similar cultural beliefs of people encourage
                them to easily trust each other remain connected in future to
                help each other. It has been analysed that religious aspects
                impacts positively on mind set and thoughts of individuals as it
                motivate elderly people to avoid certain things such suicide
                attempts, alcohol, smoke and drug abuse. These factors are
                responsible for creating number of several physical and mental
                health problems that can be avoided with the help of religions
                values.
