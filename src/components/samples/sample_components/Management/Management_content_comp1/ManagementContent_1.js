                  accounting system is also known as costing system which is
                  used to determine the cost allocation of different activity
                  operated in business. This accounting system helps Edwards to
                  manage and control the cost of activities and this tool is

                  <strong>Price optimisation system-</strong>&nbsp;This is the
                  system which is considered as mathematical programs which
                  calculate the demand which varies according to the different
                  price level. The data is combined with the calculated cost and
                  their inventory levels at recommended prices which will
                  increase the profitability (Edwards, 2013.). The Edwards uses

                  calculation of cost and it helps in determination of price of
                  the goods or products of the company. This provides benefits

                  Cherian and Jacob, 2012.). The inventory word includes raw
                  material, work-in-progress and closing stock of the company.
                  The Edwards use this system to control the raw materials of
                  the company which helps in reducing wastage as according to
                  the demand production is required to be take place. The system
                  can be used by the company to control the quantity of raw
                  material by using LIFO and FIFO. These are the techniques
                  which are used by the company to maintain the quality of raw
                  material. The last in first out refers to the system where
                  last produced quantity will be sold first and in FIFO the
                  quantity which is produced firstly has to be sold firstly.
                  This system is used by desktop, barcode scanners and other
                  devices to determine the accurate level of inventory.

                Costs form an integral part of every organisation and enable the
                business managers to easily measure the strengths as well as
                weaknesses in the form of bottlenecks in an effective manner
                (Moser, 2012. ). Based on the nature, size and type of
                organisations, costs can be mainly divided in the form of direct
                and indirect costs, materials and expenses. Costing techniques
                have been utilised to indicate optimal transparency as well as
                exercise effective control for decision-making purposes
                (Pavlatos, 2015. ). Mainly, organisations employ marginal and
                absorption costing techniques so as to prepare important
                financial statements such as Income Statements and Balance Sheet
                among others. These have been discussed as under:

            <p>
              <span>
                Under this technique, fixed and variable costs are distinguished
                in order to determine the additional, or marginal, cost incurred
                on the production of an additional unit of output. Generally,
                this costing technique is employed by the organisation in order
                to ascertain the impact of changes in input as well as output on
                the overall profit earned by the organisation. The main purpose
                served through the utilisation of this technique is that the
                contribution of product cost in terms of one unit is obtained by
                the business manager (Salterio, 2015 ). It is important to note
                that under this methodology, fixed costs are not considered.
                Marginal Costing can be mainly expressed in the terms of
                contribution earned per unit of output produced. Here, the
                variable cost is represented by the product cost whereas fixed
                cost is assumed as period cost.&nbsp;<strong>Annex (A)</strong>

                            methods is different. While the profit computed
                            through the preparation of Absorption Costing Income
                            Statement is more than that computed under Marginal
                            Costing, the loss incurred is less in the former
                            too. Thus, it is recommended that the organisation
                            must employ Absorption Costing Technique so as to
                            give a much more accurate and transparent view.
                            Additionally, this technique is also more reliable
                            as it shows Net Profit earned per unit instead of
                            simply stating Contribution earned on each unit.

                            From the income statements produced using Marginal
                            and Absorption Costing Techniques, it is clearly
                            evident that there is a difference in Net Profit
                            earned on the same units of products sold for a
                            given time-period (Otley and Emmanuel, 2013.). This
                            is mainly due to the difference in treatment of
                            Fixed Costs under both techniques. The Results
                            signal a net income of £721,000 and £150,000 for

                            accounted worth £37,150 in Q2 for dining table
                            whereas loss of £40,000 is shown as per Marginal

                            A budget is that statement which represents the
                            estimation of incomes and expenses for a specific
                            future period of time (Wouters and Kirchberger,
                            2015.). On the other hand, Budgetary control is that
                            process which assist a manager that how they can
                            control on their cost and business activities for

                            company, this will guide them that how they can
                            proper use of monetary resources and how they can

                            operations. Along with this, it also help them to
                            find the reasons behind the estimated and actual
                            figure so they can take some effective decisions for

                            Credit policy allows customers to buy the products
                            at credit without making payment at the time of

                            affect the growth and profit of the company. By
                            using KPI, organizations can calculate its
                            performance which can be expressed in quantifiable
                            numbers (Weetman, 2013.). There are software for

                            and non-financial aspects. The working of KPI starts
                            from assessing the defects and errors affecting the
                            capabilities of the company. It determines whether
                            the organization is using its resources to the
                            optimal level or not. This is done to identity
                            contingencies. The other use of KPI is to review the
                            activities associated with different departments or
                            units. By this, Edwards can focus on activities

                            activities which are working properly can be
                            improved in order to increase the efficiency.This
                            system can be used to respond the problem of
                            management of money. This will help the entity in
                            handling the money so that activities can be
                            conducted and flow of money can there in the
                            company. The company can make provisions for
                            unexpected circumstances so that no financial burden
                            has to be faced by it.

                            (Soin and Collier, 2013.).. There may arise
                            situations in which the processes need to be changed
                            according to the requirement. The company can use
                            this method to assess the problem related to later
                            payment by the buyers in order to implement it
                            effectively. Also, changes can be done in the

                            the financial difficulties such as money management
                            and late payments. This will help the company to
                            record the transactions effectively without making
                            any defects. Preparation of books of accounts as per
                            the guidelines and principles can reduce the errors
                            and defects. This increases reliability and
                            accuracy.
