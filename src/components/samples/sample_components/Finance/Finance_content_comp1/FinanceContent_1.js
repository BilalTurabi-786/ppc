                The integrated reporting framework used by an entity in order to
                enhance their reporting system to restrict the defaulters to
                enter into the system in order to break the confidentiality. The
                existing reporting process needs to be strengthen by adopting
                different methods in improving the existing working conditions
                of an entity. The primary objective of this framework is to
                reduces the hidden errors lies in the internal business system.
                The replica of transactions are also reduces by applying the
                methods of integrated reporting framework. The current
                principles are used by an entity which will help in enhancing
                the existing quality of information by supplying truth and fair
                information to other end.

                In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement
                plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined
                benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of
                information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for
                effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge
                regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it
                (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such
                aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge
                is highly required for dealing with the standards more
                effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement
                aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to
                another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance:
                UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension
                benefits in against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and
                knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                retirement benefits and deferred tax amount.

                There are several key issues which are associated with financial
                reporting enumerated below:

                  Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the
                  regulations which business entity requires following for
                  ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However,
                  sometimes is not possible for the business organization to
                  comply with all the rules to the large extent.

                  Further, some government authorities have framed and
                  introduced legislation which entail that companies are not
                  obliged to prepare financial statements according to
                  accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives
                  also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow
                  for the preparation of financial statements.
