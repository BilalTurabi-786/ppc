                Different research studies have concluded that men and women use
                language differently. As per the widespread belief “women talks
                more as compare to the men” (Hall and Bucholtz, 2012). But, most
                of the vresear4ch studies have found contradict findings about
                this beliefs. Along with this, different genders discuss
                distinct topics such as men tend to talk about sports, politics
                and cars but on the other hand women tend to discuss about child
                care and personal relationships, etc. Most of the recent work in
                sociolinguistic has focused upon the variation in conversational
                styles of men and women (Hellinger and Motschenbacher, 2015).
                The current essay is also focus on features of different
                language and their use by women and men. Along with this, it
                also focuses on impact on use of these features and its impact
                on confidence and tentativeness.Therefore, major objective of
                this essay is to assess the claim that women do in fact these
                such features more frequently than men and these features index
                lack of confidence and nervousness (Gay, Hicks, Santacreu-Vasut
                and Shoham, 2015).

                Essay will focus on the statement of Robin Lakoff in which she
                focused on gender differences to syntax, semantic and style. In
                her research study she identified that women used number of
                linguistic features which she claimed were used more often by
                women as compare to men and which shows the expressed
                uncertainty, lack of confidence and nervousness (Ervin-Tripp,
                2014). Essay will focus on different ways by which language is
                used and linguistic attitude. Further, it also shed lights on
                association between languages, culture and thoughts. Including
                this, issue of the women’s language is also considered as major
                part of this report which will help in understanding the major
                concepts of this essay. In addition, focus will also be given on
                use of distinct styles of language used by women. Research will
                find out that weather there is any difference in the way by
                which women and men make interactions with others. Therefore,
                the whole essay will focus on women’s language (De Fina and
                King, 2011).

              <span>Features of women’s language</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                Robin lakoff has identified ten elements of women’s language
                which are frequently used by women during their conversations
                (Women’s Language, 2015). All these features shows the language
                attitude of women these features are described as under:
              </span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Hedging</strong>: Women use this feature at the timer
                  of conversation which shows the uncertainty and lack of
                  authority. For example, sort of, kind of and I guess, etc
                  (Cook, 2011).
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Politeness</strong>: Women generally use super polite
                  words and forms such as would you please and I would really
                  appreciate it if, etc.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Tag questions</strong>: In women’s language, tag
                  questions added to the end of the statement and do not change
                  the statement (Kunsmann, 2013). For example, you would do
                  that, wouldn’t you?
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Emotional emphasis</strong>: Women use emotional
                  content and tone that emphasizes on emotions. For example, you
                  are so very kind and I am so grateful to you (Linn, 2014).
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Empty adjectives</strong>: Adding a friendly element
                  in the sentence shows the use of empty adjectives in
                  conversation. Although women do not use any meaningful content
                  at the time of conversation.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Correct grammar and pronunciation</strong>: Women
                  expect hypercorrect grammar and pronunciation at the time of
                  discussion and conversation. They use sales less as compare to
                  men (Erickson, Lind, Johnson and O’Barr, 1978). For example, I
                  would be very appreciate if you could show me the way of my
                  destination.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Lack of humor</strong>: women do not use humor and
                  funny words at the time of discussion. So lack of humor is
                  also one of the major feature of women’s language. So, women
                  are poor in telling jokes.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Direct quotations</strong>: Women generally quoted
                  word which have said by others for example, Rita said that he
                  said, “I won’t to do it. ‘So I said, Why Not?” (Larson,
                  Johnson and Haselton, 2012).
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Extended vocabulary</strong>: Generally, women use
                  extended vocabulary rather than simple language. For example,
                  the wall should be cerise neon pink tracer. So, use of extra
                  vocabulary is also considered as major feature of women’s
                  language.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>
                  <strong>Declarations with interrogative intonation</strong>:
                  Generally statement are used by women for asking questions by
                  intonating question mark at the end of the statement (Berger,
                  2013). For example, that sounds like a good thing to do?
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span>
                Overall, different features of women’s language has reflected
                that generally women use different words for different purpose
                as compare to the men which make different meaning for others.
                These meanings are difficult to understand by others.&nbsp; They
                use some words which shows disagreement and lack of
                authenticity. Along with this, they use different words with
                extra politeness and emotions (Baxter, 2012). Women focuses on
                correct grammar and pronunciation and extended vocabulary.

              <span>
                Sociolinguistics can be defined as a descriptive study which
                shows the effects of different aspects of society such as
                cultural norms, expectations and context on the way of language
                used. Along with this, it also helps in determining the effects
                of language used on society (Guillaume, 2014). It also focuses
                on the use of different language between distinct groups because
                of various ethnicity, religion, status and gender and income,
                etc. Some research studies also focuses on the gender in
                sociolinguistics in which study shows the use of language by
                different gender. Effects arise on use of language because of
                the belongingness of the person with different class, social
                language, restricted codes, culture and beliefs, etc (O’barr,
                2014).

            <p>
              <span>
                History of Sociolinguistics has disclosed that “social
                determinants has strong association with different language
                which increases variations for linguistic theory”. In contrast,
                some of research study has also disclosed some factors about the
                international; sociolinguistics. Along with this, background
                research studies have concluded that language is one of the
                major tool of&nbsp;communication&nbsp;which can be influenced by
                the place, speaking, people, condition and situation (Elmes,
                2013). Place is very important factor because generally it shows
                the style of language which have used by different people.
                Including this, sociolinguistics has reflected that gender and
                sexual identity also affect the use of language because of the
                culture and society. Overall, sociolinguistics shows the effects
                of different elements on use of language by different gender men
                and women (Gay, Hicks, Santacreu-Vasut and Shoham, 2015).

            <h3>
              <span>Different ways by which language is used</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                Language works as vehicle for the transmission of cultural
                knowledge and gain access to the contents of others’ minds. It
                provides opportunity to human being to express their attitude
                change, social perception, personal identity, attribution, and
                so on. In most of the cases, language involves exchanges of
                representations of personal feeling in front of others. On the
                basis of speech practices associated with gender, specific
                gender roles that are prescribed by society and language used by
                women can be explored. Communicative behavior of men and women
                differ in terms of effective use of paralinguistic features such
                as ‘mhm’ and ‘yeah’. Women generally use them most frequently as
                compared to men. In order to display active listening and
                interest, women are mostly used streams of talk”, such as “mm”
                or “yeah”. Sometimes, these meanings are difficult to understand
                by other.&nbsp; In the context of using questions in
                conversations, men and women perception are also differed. In
                addition, it is identified that women use questions more
                frequently as compared to men. Besides that, female linguistic
                behaviour characteristically indicates the interest of women to
                take turns in conversation with others (Krauss and Chiu, 2011).
                Despite of that, differences between the speech of women and men
                can be identified in terms of particles that grammarians often
                described. It can be understood with help of example. Lakoff
                (1973) taken an example to differentiate between language used
                by men and women. Researcher used to sentences including (a) “Oh
                dear, you’ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again”
                and (b) Shit, you’ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator
                again to understand difference between sentences and language
                used by gender.&nbsp; On the basis of above example, it can be
                predicted that (a) sentence is women’s language and another one
                is men language. It is found that men’s language is increasingly
                being used by women. But on the other hand, due to American
                masculine image (e.g. homosexuals), women’s language is not
                being adopted by men.

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                On the other side, on the basis of ‘stronger’ and ‘weaker’
                expletives, language used by men and women can be
                differentiated. For example, ‘shit’, ‘oh dear’, or ‘goodness’
                words are saying with feeling. These words represent strength of
                an emotion conveyed in a sentence. While some words and
                sentences used by women such as ‘trivializing’ and Oh fudge, my
                hair is on fire are meaningless and highly inappropriate. It is
                found that trait, society’s expectations, merely mirroring and
                nonlinguistic differences are responsible for creating language
                difference. In addition, Women generally quoted word which have
                said by others for example, Rita said that he said, “I won’t to
                do it. ‘So I said, Why Not?,” It create negative impact on
                listener and persons by whom women is interacting. The above
                example shows reinforces men’s position of strength in the real
                world in term of expressing opinion and share their thoughts in
                a meaning sense. In addition, linguistic reasons and an
                examination of language are the other major factors which are
                responsible for women denied equality partially. From the
                critical comparison between sentence and language used by women
                and men, it is clear that woman may freely use the neutral words
                without any risk (Talbot, 2010). For example, feminine an
                advertising executive use express her idea with other by using
                different expression such as raised eyebrow and giving reaction
                using “mm” or “yeah sentences.

              <span>Linguistic attitude</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                Linguistic can be defined as a scientific study of language and
                it has three different aspects which are language form, language
                meaning and language in context. Linguistic attitude can also be
                defined as feelings of people about their own language and
                variety of other languages of other people. There are some basic
                assumptions about the language attitude which have disclosed by
                historical research studies (Language Attitudes, 2015). These
                are described as under:
              </span>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Women talk too much.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Children cannot speak or write properly any more.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Black children are verbally deprived.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span>
                All these assumptions help in understanding behavior of
                individuals. Analysis of the language attitude helps in
                determining the emotions of women. Attitude of linguistic can be
                affected by the different factors of society such as culture,
                thought and beliefs, etc. Along with this, attitude shows that
                traits of speaker or women such as height, looks, intelligent,
                dependability, leadership, sociability and character, etc (The
                Domain of Linguistics: An Overview, 2015). Attitude of women can
                be determined by analyzing their grammar, vocabulary and
                sentence framing ways. Including this, different ways of using
                language also help in determining the attitude of women at the
                time of conversation.

            <p>
              <span>
                Language is one of the important elements of culture which help
                in understanding the human life (Erickson, Lind, Johnson and
                O’Barr, 1978). Women use this element in different manner which
                is very difficult to understand by men. Different research
                studies have concluded that language and culture are
                interrelated. Verbal expressions of individuals help in
                analyzing the culture of them. Along with this, language plays
                important role in conveying culture, norms, values and beliefs
                among others. Some articles has denoted that culture hiding
                languages. Women uses language as a primary weapon of
                communication. It helps in reflecting their personality and
                culture (The Relationship between Language and Culture, 2010).
                But sometimes due to the powerful and powerless language of
                women it is very difficult to get relationship between culture,
                thought and language of women.

              <span>
                As per the research study of Robin, women’s language is
                associated with the different issues such as uncertainty,
                politeness, lack of confidence and tentativeness, etc. As per
                the result of Gender and interaction theory, it is clear that
                interest, wants, needs and goods are the major causes affect
                language used by women to communicate with men. In addition,
                female pattern of speech, less standard use of forms of English,
                responsibility to initiate conversations and vast majority of
                questions asked by women are the major issues associated with
                the language by women during interaction. Despite of that, Cross
                linguistic examination explored that grammar, use of vocabulary,
                convey negative attitudes and personal use of pronouns are the
                other major weakness which are responsible for creating language
                issue for women in society (Lakoff, 2009).&nbsp; In addition,
                linguistic reasons, emotions, use of adjectives such as
                adorable, charming, divine and so on are the other problems
                associated with language used by women in their interaction.
                Despite of that, women movement made sexism in language occurs
                as political issue and reflects their point of view. It may be
                occurred due to several reasons such as asymmetric between pairs
                of genders differentiated term, generic sense, negative
                connotations and change the meaning of original word are the
                other major issues which are attached with the language used by
                women during personal communication and interaction with each
                other (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013). All these issues are
                described as under:

                <strong>Uncertainty</strong>: This is the major issue of the
                women’s language which occur due to the different ways and
                styles of language use. Sometimes, women uses different hedge
                which shows uncertainty and lack of authority (Feminist
                Philosophy of Language, 2010). These words are used by women in
                case of uncertain knowledge on some basic subject. Sometimes, it
                shows error in making communication with others. Therefore,
                uncertainty is one of the major issues of the women’s language.
                For example, women use this sentence “Well, I sort of looked at
                him, and then he kind of looked back. Then I guess I kept
                looking”. This sentence shows the uncertain knowledge of women
                as well as it also shows disagreement with non-absolute language
                (Larson, Johnson and Haselton, 2012).

                <strong>Politeness</strong>: As per the above analysis of the
                women’s language, female personality use huge polite words at
                the time of making discussion and conversation with other
                people. For example, do excuse me, but I really appreciate it if
                you could take a little time to help me. This statement shows
                the extra politeness of women. Sometimes it creates problem for
                other persons at the time of communication (De Fina and King,
                2011).

                <strong>Lack of confidence</strong>: women’s language is less
                forcefully as compare to men because men use bad language which
                creates force on other persons. So, less forcefulness of
                language shows the lack of confidence among women. Along with
                this, women asks lots of questions which also shows the low
                level of confidence. In contrast, men interrupt more to women at
                the time of conversation which increases the use of unnecessary
                words and hedge and tag questions which also reduce the
                confidence among women. In addition, women’s language include
                lots of instance and examples which also affect confidence of
                women (Kunsmann, 2013). Therefore, different ways of language
                used shows the lack of confidence among women.

                <strong>Tentativeness</strong>: Women’s are more tentative as
                compare to men at the time of using different words in
                conversation. It occurrence sue to the use of words more
                frequently as compare to men. Including this, women uses extra
                polite and friendly words at the time of conversation which
                shows that lack of confidence or high nervousness of threating
                others by words. So, they use such kind of words which helps in
                maintaining effective communication with people (Ervin-Tripp,
                2014). Therefore, tentativeness is also one of the major problem
                in women language.

                <strong>Interrupting behavior</strong>: It has be concluded by
                men interrupt others more than women. Analysis of the women’s
                language has reflected that women get interrupted more than men.
                Therefore, it can be concluded that women’s language is less
                interruptive as compare to men but she get more interruption at
                the time of conversations (Women’s Language, 2015).

                <strong>Conversational feedback</strong>: Women do not provide
                appropriate feedback to their partner at the time of
                conversation as compare to men. Therefore, women’s language do
                not show effective conversational feedback to other women.

                There are difference factors which include gender cultures,
                socio-cultural phenomenon and communication styles are the major
                factors which create differences in the way by which women and
                men interact with each other. Besides that, gender base
                differences such as women are more emotional and intuitive as
                compared to men and highly intensive language” to persuade
                others etc. also influence personal interaction of gender in
                their daily life. Gender-based factor is responsible for
                creating interaction issue during personal interaction with
                attorneys and business people (Craver, 2003). In addition,
                difference between men and women during personal interaction can
                be highlighted on the basis of competitive situations,
                comfortable, self-confidence and intrinsic factors such as
                diligent work and intelligence etc. On the based on research
                studies of the brain done up to now, it can say that on the
                basis of various factors which include brain size (women brain
                is 8% smaller than men’s), multi-tasking, social thinking &amp;
                interactions (women are better), emotions and math skills
                (Inferior-Parietal Lobule (IPL)” which is larger in men),
                difference in the way by which women and men interact with each
                other can be differentiated (Stone, 2009). Along with these
                factors, language (women are are more attuned to words and
                sounds), memory (Women generally have better memory than men),
                sense of direction and risk&amp; rewards (Men has a brain wired
                for risk-taking) are the other causes responsible for creating
                difference in interaction between men and women candidates.

                The current research report has concluded that women use
                language in different style as compare to men which shows that
                lack of confidence and tentativeness among women. The current
                research report has also described different features of the
                women’s language such as hedge, tag questions, Politeness,
                Emotional emphasis, Empty adjectives, Correct grammar and
                pronunciation, Lack of humor, Direct quotations, Extended
                vocabulary and Declarations with interrogative intonation. All
                these features increases different issues such as Uncertainty,
                Politeness, Lack of confidence, Tentativeness, Interrupting
                behavior and Conversational feedback.
