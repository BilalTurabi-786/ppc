                The prevailing energy crisis has raised the awareness for the
                utility of battery technology. Batteries, in which electricity
                is stored in chemical form can be recharged and reused as a
                source of power. Battery technology can be used for clearing and
                accelerating the path to a more energy dependent and greener
                framework. In the present report, a general overview of the
                battery cell has been provided. The report discusses the method
                which helps in the conversion of chemical energy into electrical
                energy. Differentiation has been made between the primary and
                secondary cell types. An attempt has been made to compare and
                contrast carbon-zinc, lead-acid and alkaline batteries.
