                Organisations that are effective stays in lengthy operations and
                are more profitable as compared to their rivals. There are
                certain traits of an effective organisation such as corporate
                social responsibility, clear directions, open communication,
                empowerment of employees and team building. One of the major
                element of effective organisation is that it should assure that
                its key operating principles, organisational structure and
                culture, job responsibilities are entirely integrated with its
                strategies and they delivers betterment in performance (Upadhaya
                Munir and Blount, 2014). Effectiveness in an organisation can be
                fostered through dimensions like optimistic leadership,
                strategic individual roles and organisational structures,
                talented workforce, effectual&nbsp;change management&nbsp;and
                allied and involved organisational culture. The present report
                is prepared on effective organisation and consultancy process
                considering the case study of Welsh Utilities Regular (WUR).
                This is a non-departmental public body made from a legislation
                passed in 2004 that is held accountable for regulating
                electricity, water, sewerage and gas industries in Wales for
                promoting short term as well as long term interests of patrons.
                It is not a policy-making government department, but it assures
                that water and energy utility industries are regulated and
                developed according to the ministerial policies that are made in
                its legal duties.

                The report is intended to make certain changes in performance
                management policy of WUR. Currently, the performance management
                policy provides employees an annual pay bonus about 35 percent
                of their present salary. This policy was expected to help in
                attracting and retaining top talented workers from private
                sector. The chosen organisation is required to attract and
                retain main workers who are having good knowledge and expertise
                for reputed gas and electricity firms. The board has asked to
                review the performance management approach of WUR so that when
                employees are given their bonus, it should develop a feeling in
                them that it is due to their job objectives and their
                performance which went above the set expectations and targets.
                For this purpose, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been taken
                into account for improving the performance management policies
                of WUR.

              <span>
                According to the views of Sallis, (2014) Total Quality
                Management is an approach of management which was propounded in
                1950s and slowly it became a very famous approach since early
                1980s. It describes the attitude, culture and organisation of a
                firm which strives for providing its consumers with those
                products and services which satisfies their wants and desires.
                This is a method through which management and staff gets engaged
                in the constant improvement of production of products and
                services. This approach is a combo of management tools and
                quality aiming at increase in business and decreasing losses
                because of inefficient policies and practices. It is a
                management philosophy which aims at integrating all functions of
                organisation such as finance, marketing, production, customers
                service, engineering etc. for focusing on fulfilling need of
                patrons and objectives of organisation as well. This approach
                views a firm as a combination of processes. This method tries to
                maintain that firms should try to constantly improve the
                processes by implementing skills and competencies of employees.
                However, Goetsch and Davis, (2014) argued that Total Quality
                Management can be summed-up as a management system for customer
                oriented organisation which engages its staff for continuous
                betterment. This system takes use of strategies, data and
                effectual communication for integrating quality discipline
                within culture and activities of an organisation. Several
                concepts are currently used in modern Quality Management Systems
                that is a modern form of TQM. This approach is an enhancement in
                the old methods of doing business. It is a proven tool which
                gives guarantee of survival in the cut-throat competition. Just
                by making changes in management actions, entire organisational
                culture and actions gets transformed. There are four important
                phases in Total Quality Management. The first stage is Planning
                phase in which is the most essential stage in TQM. At this step,
                staff is told to convey their problems and issues which should
                be resolved. They are told to come up with their challenges
                which they face during their routine jobs and examines the root
                cause of problem. At this stage, staff is needed to conduct some
                important research and gather relevant data and information that
                will be helpful to find out solutions for all problems. Then
                comes the second phase of doing. Here staff tries to bring out a
                solution for the problems and issues which were defined in the
                previous step. Strategies are designed and executed for
                overcoming the challenges and the effectiveness of strategies
                and solutions are checked. The third stage is of checking under
                which comparative assessment of before and after data is done
                for confirming the effectiveness of processes and to measure
                outcomes. The last phase is called as acting phase in which
                employees showcase their outcomes and get ready to solve other
                issues.

            <h4>
              <span>Basic elements of TQM</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span>
                The successful implementation of Total Quality Management should
                include technical as well as people aspects which covers the
                whole organisation and broaden to relationship with patrons and
                suppliers. The basic constituents covers the gist of TQM
                philosophy in which first one is focus on customers. Wang Chen
                and Chen, (2012) stated that decision regarding organisation of
                resources for best serving the consumers begins with a clear-cut
                apprehension of wants and needs of patrons and measurement of
                consumer gratification. For instance, WUR is responsible in
                regulation of electricity, water, sewerage and gas industries
                for promotion of short term and long term interests of customers
                as well. Thus, by knowing needs and experiences of patrons
                regarding the services which they are getting for water supply,
                gas, electricity supply, sewerage system, WUR can identify the
                strengths and weaknesses of the services and makes changes if
                desired. The next important element of TQM is continuous
                improvement. If an organisation has a constant learning culture
                and problem solving culture then there are very less chances of
                defects and mistakes. The Toyota Production System is a
                universally accepted system for continuous improvement which is
                utilised by many distinct types of firms. There are some crucial
                components of this system which consists of study of process
                flow, collection of data and information, removing out the waste
                non-value-added tasks and activities and giving everybody the
                responsibility of quality improvement. Nevertheless, Oakland,
                (2014) asserted that employee involvement is an another
                constituent of Total Quality Management. Under a TQM
                environment, employees have distinct roles and responsibilities
                compared with a traditional organisation. They are provided
                accountability, training and authorization for measuring and
                controlling the quality of work they are producing, they work
                collectively for addressing the issues related to quality, they
                are given cross training to make them capable to do multiples
                tasks and develop understanding of total production process, and
                they are having a more intense apprehension of operating and
                maintaining the equipments. Employees are important for building
                constant betterment in an organisation. The next essential
                component of TQM is quality tools which is extended above the
                scope of this discussion, but there are seven quality tools
                which are taken in use by front-line managers and employees to
                monitor quality performance and collect data for making
                improvement in quality activities. These tools consists of
                flowcharts, checklists, scatter diagrams, Pareto analysis,
                histograms, fish-bone diagrams. Another essential element of TQM
                is product design which is a major activity for avoiding costly
                interior and exterior cost related to failures. Process
                management is one more crucial component of TQM which states
                that management and staff should emphasise on detailed
                activities in a process in which poor or good quality is made.
                The last but significant constituent of TQM is supplier quality.
                The attention on quality is on the part of supplier also, as the
                quality of end product is only good as quality of its detached
                parts and elements, irrespective of whether they come via
                intrinsic or extrinsic sources

              <span>Tools of Total Quality Management</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span>
                When an organisation wants to initiate a Total Quality
                Management Program or make improvements in it, it has to take
                use of some common tools for quality improvement procedures. In
                accordance with the view of Talib Rahman and Qureshi, M.N.,
                (2013) the purpose of Total Quality Management is to decrease
                the happenings of mistakes within manufacturing or service
                procedures. With this, firms are able to streamline and kind of
                modifications by updating equipments and training to staff in an
                effective manner. This in turn will satisfy patrons. But firms
                are not able to apply Total Quality Management without taking
                use of correct tools. The first tools is Pareto Principle which
                states that most of mistakes occur due to certain causes. In
                terms of ratio, 80 percent of problems are related to 20 percent
                of causes. Thus, this tool points out that 20 percent causes the
                problem. This principle permits managers to deal with strictness
                with this 20 percent which is cause of the issue that usually
                consists of machine or operating errors. The next tool is
                control charts under which data is plotted in a historical
                manner to see the changes in processes with the time. These
                charts holds a central line for average, upper and lower line
                which shows the upper and lower control limitation. Flow charts
                are also supporting in TQM as they permit management to see the
                flow of processes is well or not. This is done with the help of
                words, pictures etc. along with pointers to next data flow
                point. The data flow points includes problems, solutions,
                objectives etc. Withal, Conti, (2012) quoted that an another
                tools is Scatter Plots and Diagrams. Generally, scatter plot
                resembles like a line graph without any line. The point of data
                points in this is to depict in what manner one data point
                correlated with other data point in positive or negative manner.
                If data is close to create a straight line, then there is great
                possibility that one point is correlated with the next point.
                Diagrams are also used for analysing process distribution which
                is done through cause and effect diagrams that showcases the key
                cause and less causes can impact a problems. The intended impact
                will be that problem will get solved. But the diagram will
                depict the either mode. For instance, WUR can takes use of this
                tools when managers want to coordinate data in a positive manner
                and make a straight line. Check sheets and Checklists are the
                ultimate key TQM tools. Check sheets are the forms which collect
                data and permit users to analyse and interpret data easily. They
                are only meant for collecting single kind of data and
                information at one time. Therefore, they are very good for that
                type of which is going to repeat many times. On the other hand,
                checklists ate for dealing with a particular problems which
                allows managers of WUR to check and see whether all essential
                steps have been taken or not. They are same as check-sheets,
                they are taken in use for assisting along with the operation
                processes and not collecting the data. One more tool of TQM is
                force field analysis which is utilised for identification of
                driving and restricting forces happening under a selected
                process for understanding why that specific process functions as
                it does. For identifying restricting forces which should be
                eliminated, or driving forces which are require to be improved,
                for functioning at a high efficiency level. An another
                significant tool of Total Quality Management is histograms which
                are graphical representation of distribution of numeric data.
                This is an estimation of probability distribution of a
                quantitative variable which is continuous. This is a type of bar
                graphs. For constructing a histogram, the initial step is “bin”
                the range of values which means to divide the whole range of
                values in a serial of intervals and after that count the values
                which comes under every interval. Bins are generally specified
                as non-overlapping and sequential intervals of variable. The
                bins should be adjacent and should be mostly of equivalent size.
                If they are having equal size, a rectangle erects over the bins
                with a high proportion to frequency i.e. number of cases under
                every bin. This tool provide a rough idea of density of inherent
                data distribution and most of the times for estimating density :
                estimation of probability density function of the inherent
                variable.

                organisational effectiveness

            <p>
              <span>
                There may be a debate on the extent to which TQM tools within
                WUR can improve its effectiveness. This is being assumed that
                TMQ is helpful in highlighting the market needs. The application
                of TQM is universally acceptable and is supportive for
                organisation such as WUR in identifying and fulfilling market
                needs in a better manner. Bon and Mustafa, (2013) argued that it
                is helpful to energising innovation process. Innovations and
                inventions emphasise on quality of services. The innovative
                aspects of key or peripheral services appeals to the services
                users. Also the professionals find it easy to market the
                innovative services in a profitable manner. TQM leads to cost
                effectiveness which is very important for endurance of any type
                of organisation. Organisations should be aiming at spending
                their resources in a productive way. During development of
                services, due attention should be paid to cost-benefit analysis.
                Training sessions and incentive plans should be brought for
                making the employees more productive. However it can also be
                argued that implementation of total quality management system in
                chosen firm needs extensive training to workers and it needs
                them to give some time from their routine work responsibilities
                and roles. While the betterment does decreases lead time,
                removes wastage and improves productivity, the initial stages of
                execution of total quality management within an organisation can
                decrease employee output. On the other side, implementation of
                TQM is favoured by Madu, (2012) saying that it ensures better
                quality performance in each domain of activities. Adverse and
                non-involvement attitude and behaviour of staff are the most
                significant hurdle in success, growth and advancement of
                organisation. TQM focuses on introducing attitudinal changes and
                betterment in employee performance by encouraging appropriate
                work culture and efficacious team work. It offers fabulous
                chances for self development and increasing interests of workers
                towards their jobs. The techniques and tools of TQM are
                significantly assistive in knowing and understanding the
                competition and also in development of an effectual combating
                strategies. Because of the intense competition, survival of
                several firms is a vital issue. Total Quality Management is
                helpful in understanding the patrons and market as well. It
                gives a chance to organisation to face the competition by
                applying the TQM techniques. Nevertheless, the counter argument
                of Al-Swidi and Mahmood, (2012) is a weak point of TQM which
                says that total quality management needs change is thinking,
                attitude and ways of performing jobs by staff. If the management
                does not communicate the team approach of TQM is an effective
                manner, employees may develop fear in their minds which results
                in employee resistance.

                If employees resists towards TQM programme, it can lessen staff
                morale and productivity for the organisation. Also it is an
                expensive approach for implementation. Execution of this
                technique mostly brings additional training cost, team
                development costs, consultancy fees, improvement cost in
                infrastructure and many more. This system emphasises on
                standardisation of tasks for ensuring consistency which
                discourages creativity and innovation in organisation. This also
                discourages new and out-of-box ideas which are likely to make
                improvement in productivity. This is further supported by fact
                stated by Herzallah Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez and Munoz Rosas, (2014)
                total quality management programmes remove defects and wastage
                that results in reduction of production cost of businesses. When
                teams meets for identifying and eliminating weaknesses in the
                business, firm enjoys decreased costs and high profitability.
                Team of quality management are able to eliminate mistakes and
                errors, decrease lead time and determine redundancy in the
                process of production which can importantly add in the profits
                that are earned by organisations. TQM showcases a fair image of
                services. This system facilitates service organisation in
                delivering consistent quality of products. Furthermore, to
                maintain consistency in profit producing inspires all the
                parties which are concerned about this. They make a favourable
                viewpoint regarding services firm. Patrons receives quality
                services, staff gets fabulous incentives and investors attains
                profitable returns on their investments which they made. Thus,
                Total Quality Management depicts a fair image of service firms
                amid general public that is helpful for organisation to progress
                slowly in the long run. TQM is also helpful in development of a
                sufficient system of communication. Defective and insufficient
                communication and inappropriate processes are an obstacle in the
                path of appropriate development and growth of a firm. This leads
                to confusions, misunderstandings, lower productivity, bad
                quality, copying of of efforts given by staff and lower morale.
                Techniques of TQM brings together the individuals of several
                linked sections, departments and management levels for
                efficacious communication and interaction.

                The current report is prepared on effective organisation and
                consultancy process for which case study of Welsh Utilities
                Regular (WUR) is taken into account. From the above report it is
                concluded that to improve performance management approaches in
                chosen organisation, Total Quality Management will be the most
                suitable tool. The concept of total quality management has been
                discussed in the report from which it is observed that it is a
                way from which managers and employees gets involved in continual
                betterment of production of goods and services. Certain tools of
                TQM such as Pareto, Principle, control charts, flow charts,
                scatter plots and diagrams, check sheets and Checklists, force
                field analysis and histograms are being determined in the report
                which are significantly supporting the cited organisation. It is
                to be summed up that these tools have proved effective for
                making improvement in performance and effectiveness of quoted
                organisation. Then a critical assessment of degree to which TQM
                can improve organisational effectiveness is being conducted in
                the report from which it is concluded that TQM system should be
                applied by making a balance betwixt its strengths and drawbacks
                by the stated firm.
