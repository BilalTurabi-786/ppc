<p><span>Potential Risks</span></p>
<p><span>Every project contains several risks which negatively hamper the outcomes and deliverables of the project work. In the context of ERP project for Abundant Produce Limited, project manager has appointed a Risk Assessor that can able to determine the best possible hazards in the plan and their impacts on entire working plan (Azimi and et.al., 2011). From the risk assessment, there are five types of risks in development of ERP project which are as follows:&nbsp;<strong>New and unproven technologies</strong>: In general, majority software projects needed the application of use of new technologies. In the ever changing tools, methods, techniques, standards, protocols and increase the requirement of system developments have increased the risks related to technology. In the case of ERP project for Abundant Produce Limited, the changes of occurrence of this type of problem has raised because improper use of technologies have lead directly to failure of project (Hazır, 2015).&nbsp;<strong>Users and functional requirements</strong>: At the time of development of a project, it becomes important to consider the all requirements of the users such as system features, functions, and quality of service. In the case of ERP project of Abundant Produce Limited, users and functional requirements risk has occurred because at the time of development different modules and their integration, the client requirements have varied along with the new system functioning (Meredith and Mantel Jr, 2011).&nbsp;<strong>Application and system architecture</strong>: The less understanding towards application and system architecture of new ERP system for Abundant Produce Limited, it has increased the risk for the entire project. This has moved the plan in the opposite direction which may affect the overall outcomes of activities (Müller and et.al., 2013).&nbsp;<strong>Performance</strong>: It becomes most important to ensure to measure the performance of the project as per the expectations and set performance criteria. By considering the case study of Abundant Produce Limited, project manager has not developed some performance methods to evaluate the effectiveness of entire plan. The overall impact of this has made on the functioning of the plan and its deliverables (Kerzner, 2013). Rather than the above stated risks, some other occurred risks in ERP project has resource allocation, improper communication, unavailability of skilled staff, ineffective scheduling of the plan, scope creep etc (Mar, 2013). To overcome all these risks along with their impacts on action plan, the project manager has adopted the risk management plan which has as follows:</span></p>
