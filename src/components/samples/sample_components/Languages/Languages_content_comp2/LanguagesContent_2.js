                In current scenario, English has become a global language. In
                some of the countries this language is now being used as the
                mother language. There are many reasons that have contributed in
                the rise of this language all across the world. In such a
                condition, it is very important for individual to utilize this
                language in a correct and an appropriate manner, both in written
                and spoken manner (Using English.com, 2008). While writing,
                Grammar is the foremost thing which must be kept in mind. As per
                my study, most of the time, there are articles and journals
                written just for the sake of writing. The proper use of grammar
                and punctuations are mostly missing. This affects the quality of
                what is been written. In this report, with the help of an online
                published article, we’ll evaluate all the different grammatical
                pros and cons. The article is about the importance of English
                language in current scenario (Donovan, 2012).2 An Article on
                Importance of English Language We are all aware of the fact that

                The Universal language used now days is English. Most of the top
                worldwide universities now use English as one of the major
                subject. In terms of education and many other things, India is
                also competing with the other countries, and hence it is forced
                to maintain some global standards. In all these things, English
                is the foremost criteria in all the major fields, may it be a
                job, or studies in international universities. Without a strong
                base for English no university is going to entertain students,
                and no organization is going to select any candidate at
                international level. Even if the candidates are very
                knowledgeable, but does not possess a good command over English,
                they aware immediately rejected. Where ever we go, the first
                round is of self introduction, and the second round is of group
                discussion and then finally comes, the interview. If the
                candidate is not aware of the Basic English language, he is
                eliminated at the first round itself.

                People have a misconception that learning English is a very
                tough job; however, this is not at all difficult. If taken
                admission in a right institute, where the major focus of the
                teacher is to impart best of the English knowledge in the
                student, make very easy to learn and understand English. Believe
                me, learning English is a fun. Yes, it is very true that one
                cannot learn English immediately; it totally depends on the
                current level of the person. If people starts learning English
                form the very starting, it will take a time of 4-5 months if for
                2 hours, classes are held from Monday to Friday. Institute must
                teach good English. I really don’t understand, that why people
                get scared of learning English.

                People get scared of this language and hopeless just after
                trying for few days. They stop trying after taking admission in
                one or two institute, just because they are afraid. Actually,
                the major fact is that when a person wants to learn English he
                must first do a research on the institute he’s joining to learn
                English. It is not at all necessary, that the person who can
                write good English can also speak good English. People must be
                aware of the fact, that there is a major difference between
                written and spoken English. So, while joining any English
                teaching institute, one must be very cautious about its motive.
                He must identify, that weather the institute is good at teaching
                spoken English or at Written English. There are many
                institutions for teaching good English; some are good at
                teaching written English while some are good at teaching spoken
                English. There are many institutes in Delhi, where one can learn
                how to speak fluent English. These institutes do their work
                carefully.

                    possess a good personality, will his motive will be

                    program is very important with English. With good English,
                    one must have a good personality, and carry knowledge about
                    it. There is some institute which provides these types of
                    personality courses free of cost with English teaching. The
                    courses also include interview techniques with some minimum
                    amount of cost, once the student is engaged with the English
                    language style (Kumar, 2010).

                Evaluation of English Language Style: As per the above ArticleIn
                any of the language, use of different expression and styles are
                very appropriate. The use depends on the different situation.
                English is a very vat language, and if not used properly, it can
                change the entire meaning. When it comes to writing, the matter
                must be written in such a manner, that it is clearly
                understandable. There must be a proper use of all the
                punctuation at different place. There must be proper utilization
                of correct spellings, and at last, all the phrases and sentences
                must be properly addressed (Rivers, 2004).Auxiliary
                VerbsAuxiliary verbs are the verb, which are used forming the
                tenses, aspects, mood, and voice of the other verbs. In English
                the primary auxiliary verbs are have, be, will, and do. The
                model auxiliary verbs are could, can, might, may, must, should,
                shall, and would. Each of the primary auxiliary word is followed
                by some another verb, which is known as full verb, and from a
                question, a negative statement, a compound tense, or a passive
                voice (English leap.com, 2013).The main verb together with the
                auxiliary verb makes a complete verb, known as verb Phrase.

                                  <strong>Passive Voice</strong>Passive voice is
                                  used in the case, when the main focus is on
                                  the action. In case of passive voice, the
                                  object of the active voice becomes the subject
                                  of passive voice. Here, the importance of
                                  object is more than subject (English Grammar

                                  is evaluates, and hence, in this case,
                                  Personality development program is the main
                                  focus.

                                  known as modifiers. Modifiers are of two

                                  of the case, the noun has both pre and post
                                  modifier attached in the sentence. Use of post
                                  modification in the sentences make a writes
                                  more specific and the whole lot of information
                                  is summed up in limited number of sentences,

                                              Passive voice is used in the case,
                                              when the main focus is on the
                                              action. In case of passive voice,
                                              the object of the active voice
                                              becomes the subject of passive
                                              voice. Here, the importance of
                                              object is more than subject

                                              In the first example, Universal
                                              language is the main focus, and
                                              English here becomes the secondary
                                              objective.In second example, we
                                              were specifically speaking about
                                              the institute and hence, the
                                              subject English becomes less
                                              important.In the third example,
                                              the importance of personality
                                              development program in English is

                                              program is the main focus.

                                              modifiers. Modifiers are of two

                                              modifiers.In some of the case, the
                                              noun has both pre and post
                                              modifier attached in the sentence.
