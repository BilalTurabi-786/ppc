                therapy and traditional medicine in which different services are
                delivered to the patients in unique manner. There are many types
                of treatment that typically exit under complementary therapy and
                which also involves conventional&nbsp;medical&nbsp;system
                (Barcelona de Mendoza, Harville, Savage and Giarratano, 2016).

                medicine and yoga. These therapies are important in the realm of

                has been made on types of complementary benefits and how it aids
                in improving the life of a person. The entire study has been
                made on Lifeline which is entitled in delivering complementary
                therapy services; thus in such respect focus has been laid on
                role of complementary therapies in orthodox treatment.

                and validity of information sources on complementary therapy.

                complementary therapies in society.

                      Acupuncture is useful for the purpose of giving
                      appropriate knowledge to the patients of Lifeline
                      regarding the use of body massage and other pressure

                      Improper use of pressure points can lead to other health

                      Aromatherapy basically aids in giving relaxation to the
                      patients; hence this can assist in relieving mental stress
                      and tension (McVicar, Greenwood, Ellis and LeForis, 2016).
                      With the help of this therapy, health and wellbeing
                      aspects can be encouraged accordingly.

                      Such therapies take time to give positive outcomes; hence
                      most often patients at Lifeline drop the idea to continue
                      to the treatment.

                      Such therapies are costly; however they are the most
                      modern methods of providing medication to the patients.
                      Complementary therapies can also work as supportive
                      treatments which also aids in controlling health problems
                      which usually arise in different age groups.

                      Counselling is highly significant for the purpose of

                      Since, it consumes time; therefore it does not give

                      is effective only when the patients give optimum support
                      to the counsellors of Lifeline (Rose, Browne and Bryden,
                      2016).

                      especially on continuous basis. At the same time, it also

                    that due to unavailability of economic sources, most often
                    patients do not get the opportunity for proper psychological
                    treatment (Tussing and Wren, 2017).

                    Cultural factors: There are various people who do not prefer
                    to undergo for complementary therapies due to their social
                    and cultural values. For instance – most of the youngsters
                    do not go to counsellors as they get insecure about their
                    social status.

                    Hence, this is another factor that reduces the chances of

                    Usually, the disorder is treated through drugs; however
                    Lifeline can also make use of complementary therapy to treat

                    respect, assistance can be acquired from Osteopathy therapy
                    which involves massage to the bones and affected muscles.
                    Therefore, along with Orthodox treatment, health care

                    results in enzyme deficiency. Lifeline complementary
                    services are required to consider appropriate delivery of
                    drugs and medicines so that such deficiency could be
                    improved balanced. For example- patient having diabetes can
                    switch to complementary services such as to Chromium which
                    may improve in controlling diabetes. Chromium is required
                    for a diabetic for the purpose of making glucose tolerance
                    factor and at the same time it also helps insulin to
                    generate positive results (McFeeters, Pront, Cuthbertson and
                    King, 2016). Apart from this, Ginseng can also be given to

                People have developed different perception regarding
                complementary therapies; however it differs according to
                positive and negative attitude. Some people have developed
                positive attitude about complementary services as they have
                accepted the benefits of the same. In this area, many people say
                that because of complementary therapies, there are distinct
                health problems which have solved yet (Hu and et.al., 2016).
                Furthermore, people have also accepted the services because
                complementary services of Lifeline are easily available. Along
                with this, people also consider complementary services
                beneficial because it does not have side effects. People also
                have a perception that complementary services are enjoyable
                especially during massage and other relaxing services (Johns,
                Bobat and Holder, 2016). However, on the other hand some people
                have negative attitude as well regarding complementary therapies
                because of less information. Lack of education and knowledge is
                one of the apparent factors that changes the mind-set of people
                towards diverse health care services. Further, most of the
                people also consider it time consuming activity because the
                outcomes which it gives takes too much time. Thus, according to
                the negative and positive perception, it is clear that people
                have difference of opinion about complementary therapy; hence
                this also changes the opportunities of access. It is also
                identified that due to cultural values and norms, some people do
                not prefer to get assistance from counsellors and therapies;
                thus they only prefer to get treatment through drugs (Kerr and
                et.al., 2016). At the same time, people also believe that
                complementary therapy services do not have any specific cure;
                hence less people get access for the same.

                Complementary therapies have several psychological effects;
                however this varies as per the health problems and disorders
                (Barcelona de Mendoza, Harville, Savage and Giarratano, 2016).
                For instance- a college going student is facing mental health
                issues because of depression; hence for the same the patient
                needs to get assistance from counselling services so that to
                come out with all the internal problems. At the same time, it
                can also be said that because of depression, the person is
                feeling lonely and isolated; hence with the help of suitable
                counselling services, all such issues could be managed
                accordingly. In terms of stating about psychological effects, it
                is evident that counsellors can enhance the comfort zone of the
                patient so that the problems could be revealed. Similarly, this
                can also aid the patient to feel better after disclosing all the
                health problems. Hence, counselling not only improves mental
                status; but also it encourages the person to switch towards a
                healthy and balanced life (Carpenter, Webb, Bostock and Coomber,
                2017). Another example can be quoted here of a patient having
                learning disabilities. At the time of managing such patient,
                Lifeline is required to make use of alternative techniques
                (under complementary therapy) so that interest of patient can be
                identified in the same care provision. This is also useful for
                the purpose of involving the patient in care services. Thus, in
                order to treat autistic patients, health care practitioners of
                Lifeline are required to focus on psychological therapies
                suitably (Graham and Gray, 2016). This involves close
                monitoring, suitable communication and direct interaction with
                the patient; hence this is one of the most effective methods of
                dealing with autistic patients.

            <p>

                On the basis of general terminology, a contraindication is a
                specific situation wherein a drug or surgical procedure cannot
                be used because of its harmful effects to the person. There are
                basically two types of contraindications such as relative
                contraindication and absolute contraindication (Gregory and
                et.al., 2017). It is also the opposite of indication which gives
                a justifiable reason to use a specific treatment. Absolute
                contraindication means that there is no reasonable circumstance
                to undertake any course of action. For instance- when children
                have viral infection, they should not be given aspirin because
                it develops the risk of Reye’s syndrome. This might also enhance
                allergy in the child. The other category is relative
                contraindication in which the patient is at a risk of developing
                more complications; however such risks may be balanced by
                adopting different measures of health management. For example-
                in pregnancy, women usually avoid getting X-rays; however such
                risks may be balanced through proper diagnosis of any other
                serious health issue (Hu and et.al., 2016). Contrary to the
                same, it can be said that in order to treat an autistic patient,
                it is essential for the health care practitioners to focus more
                on complementary therapies as compared to orthodox treatment. In
                this situation, contraindication should be avoided as delivery
                of drugs and medicines can affect the patient differently. Thus,
                assistance could only be delivered through complementary
                therapies.

                Validity of an assessment is the degree which measures all such

                with that to reliability up to an extent and it also gives
                measurement results which are typically very much consistent
                (Johns, Bobat and Holder, 2016). However, on the other hand
                reliability is considered as the degree to which an assessment
                tool helps in producing stable and consistent results and
                outcomes. Both the terms (reliability and validity) are useful
                for the purpose of defining the accuracy aspects of information.
                Apart from this, there are different sources which are useful to
                provide information to people regarding complementary services
                such as internet, radio, journals and newspapers (Kerr and
                et.al., 2016). Articulating all the sources, Lifeline can make
                use internet and published articles to generate awareness among
                people regarding the availability of complementary services.
                However, prior using any source, it is essential for Lifeline to
                emphasize on all such factors that make the source valid and
                reliable (London, Muller, Handlin, Harlén, Lindmark and Ekström,
                2016). For instance- before getting any information from
                internet sources, it is vital to analyse the authencity and
                accuracy aspects as that only makes the source highly reliable.
                In addition to the same, while getting information about any
                profession, it is crucial to focus on expertise advice and
                opinion so that level of accuracy and authencity can be defined.
                Proper emphasis should also be laid on the type of information

                diverse exercises. In the journal, it is discussed that diabetes

                also characterized by hyperglycemia and that mainly occurs due
                to absolute or relative deficiency of insulin hormone. Thus,

                complementary therapy services are quite effective in terms of
                dealing with health problems of people. For diabetic patient,
                complementary therapy services are crucial (especially for older
                people) as through that several aspects of the health can be
                managed in systematic manner (Smith, Chang, Brownhill and Barr,

                can be said that there are varied benefits of complementary
                therapy services. Both the recommended services ought to be
                provided as per the health requirements as that can benefit the
                patient in diverse contexts (Tussing and Wren, 2017).

                Concluding the overall research procedure it can be said that as
                per the health care requirements, prominent services could be
                delivered to the patients. This is not only useful in
                eradicating health consequences, but also it will aid in
                enhancing life aspects of the patient. The study has also made
                it clear that prior acquiring information about any health care
                provision, it is useful to analyse the reliability and validity
                aspects. Furthermore, in the research work, it is also
                ascertained that legal and ethical dimensions are required to be
                followed while delivering complementary services in place of
                orthodox services.
