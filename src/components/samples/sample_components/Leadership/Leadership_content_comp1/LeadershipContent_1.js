                The oldest and the most relevant management and marketing
                mantra, that has been and will always remain is ‘Consumer is the
                King’. When Director Jorge Rubio of PepsiCo dynamically
                transformed the marketing and research unit at PepsiCo in to a
                more innovative and creative Consumers Strategic Insight, the
                aforesaid marketing mantra was the key to this transformation.
                The objective of the said revolution is to get a detailed
                proactive insight into what the consumers really want and
                convert them into foresights to prepare the organization to
                bring innovative products to satisfy this want. The key element
                here is “sensing” which consumer needs are under served both
                from a corporate and current perspective and responding
                accordingly. This proactive and innovative approach
                of&nbsp;leadership&nbsp;is a key to the out of box thinking and
                creative outcome of the team. Out of the various theories of
                Leadership which is the most apt for a particular organization
                is a matter of debate as the leadership has to be dynamic and
                responding to changes proactively rather than following set path
                of any particular theory. Thus, what PepsiCo has done in this
                case is a classic example of contingency and contemporary
                theories of Leadership sailing in the same boat together powered
                by the Traits of the leader and the intricacies of the
                situation.

              <span>
                Collins (2010) has mentioned in his analysis of the Leadership
                style at Pepsi that its hardcore rival Coca Cola has to spend
                enormous financial resources in order to stay ahead in
                competition, whereas Pepsi’s effective leadership style often
                gains competitive edge in many aspects with optimum use of its
                financial resources. The Consumer Strategic Insight set up is a
                classic example of the innovative leadership style. Leaders play
                an important role in the success of any organization and their
                leadership flair takes the organization to greater heights. It
                not only has tangible effects on in terms of financial gains and
                competitive edge but also intangible optimistic effects within
                the organization such as energized environment and motivated
                employees.

                In this case, the Consumer Strategic insight team members have
                been given a free hand for creative thinking, innovative
                approach to consumer demand analysis, data collection,
                interpretation and usage and to keep on trying new ideas and not
                fear failure. When looking up to Google’s corporate creativity
                center and having the idea materialize at Pepsi, the Director
                Gorge Rubio has projected the contemporary and transformational
                theory of leadership where the leader stimulates and inspires
                the team members to achieve extraordinary outcomes by
                transforming their vision and personality to change
                expectations, discernments and motivations for working towards
                common goal of the organization. This has resulted in provided
                PepsiCo the upper hand in competition and catering to its
                customers in a manner where the others fail. PepsiCo has many
                insights teams — at least 22 across North American beverages,
                corporate, the Frito-Lay group and so on. These teams comprise
                of about 16 members each and are powered with urbane market
                research function that uses focus groups, sales data and
                research to analyze who its customers are and what they want.
                This data is then sent to other Business Units and groups within
                the company — marketing or product, for example — so they can
                use it to make better decisions.

                It is the work of the Leader to ensure that the followers are
                aptly motivated, stimulated and enthusiastic in achieving the
                common goal of the organization. As times and situations change,
                the leaders adapt to different leadership theories and styles to
                overcome the challenges and tap the opportunities making the
                team the key element of the organizations success alongwith the
                external factors. In this case, there are no formal targets or
                set guidelines which would provide a roadmap for the employees
                to follow and the leader to evaluate. Here, the style or theory
                of leadership which the management is following is subject to
                loose controls rather than monitored performance. Therefore, it
                is important to lead the team members in a way that would foster
                greater creativity as well as help achieve the goal of increased
                efficiency and innovation in Consumer Strategic insights.

                Director Gorge Rubio, in this case of PepsiCo, aimed at creating
                an environment promoting creative ideas, energizing and creating
                a sense of purpose for employees and team members of the
                Customer Strategic insight team and motivating the employees to
                think innovative with excitement and momentum for change. These
                are the traits of inspirational motivation ensuring that all the
                members work collaboratively towards a shared purpose in their
                own unique way. It includes providing employees with the
                required resources needed to grow and empower them as well as
                place accountability on them of their own success. This is an
                important competency a Leader should possess in order to
                function in an open environment like in this case. The following
