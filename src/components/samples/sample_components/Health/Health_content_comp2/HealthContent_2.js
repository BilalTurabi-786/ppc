                Fall prevention can be determined as a situation or an action to
                reduce the number of accidents that are face by older people due
                to falls. The injury that is caused due to falls and fall are
                the most common and serious medical&nbsp;problems that are faced
                by older adults (Granacher, Gollhofer and Muehlbauer, 2013).
                When a person is facing serious health issues and when a fall
                occurs, then the condition becomes worse. As per the data, it
                can be stated that about 1/3 of the people every year fall and
                half of them fall twice. This type of issues occur because of
                decreased reflexes and mobility and underlying osteoporosis.
                Results of fall causes fractures, head injury and most of the
                cases even death. This research will cover different type of
                secondary research done on this topic.

                There are different type of research done on fall prevention.
                This study will enable to provide proper information about the
                issues and strategies that are implemented by health and social
                care so that they will be able to reduce its impact and older
                people can be provided with better services (DiBardino, Cohen
                and Didwania, 2012). In this context, below given are five

                As per the articles that has been done about, in the first
                article, it has been found that in hospitals there are
                conditions in which patients fall per 1000 patients days in
                targeted units during the period of study (Dykes Carroll and
                et.al., 2010). When compared with the other articles there are
                no research that has been done in this area. This shows that
                there are accidents that take place in the hospitals and it is
                important that professional take appropriate steps to reduce the
                impact. Healthcare professionals should be given with fall
                prevention tool kit so that accidents of fall can be reduced.

            <p>
              <span>
                In the finding, it can be stated that there are different type
                of programmes or strategies that are implemented in order to
                reduce fall. The second article talks about exercise programmes
                in order to reduce injury in community (El-Khoury, Cassou and
                et.al., 2013). Both article 1 and article 2 are similar but the
                strategies that are used is different. Further, there are about
                4305 participants involved and all were taken above the age of
                60. In addition to this, 17 trials were conducted. All these
                analyses were helpful enough to come up with appropriate
                solution that exercise programmes were helpful.

            <p>
              <span>
                In article 3 there are no participants taken as all the article
                is based on different secondary research that has already been
                done by different researchers. This article is helpful to know
                the main causes due to which fall occur (Annweiler,
                Montero-Odasso and et.al., 2010). This is generally after the
                age of 60 when eyes, bones and muscles gets weaker. In such
                situation, one of the major element that are helpful is Vitamin
                D which is important in the body so as to make sure that the
                fall can be reduced and this is been done by providing proper
                diet.
              </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                Article 1, 2 and 4 are similar as they all talk about different
                strategies which can be implemented with the help of which falls
                can be reduced. In this article, researcher talks about
                inpatient fall prevention program in which professional will
                make sure that all they all precaution is taken and they are
                provided with proper safety is provided to them so that they
                will be able to make sure that falls can be reduced and older
                people can provided with proper safety (Miake-Lye, Hempel and
                et.al., 2013). Further, this study includes 4 meta analyse and
                19 studies involved which makes this study more reliable and
                effective.

                In article 5, researcher talks about providing professional or
                seniors with proper training so that they will be able to make
                sure that they provide safe services to old people. This article
                is different from other researches (Bridenbaugh and Kressig,
                2010). When compared with all the other research this research
                is done over the professionals and rest others are done over old
                people or patients who are above the age of 60 years.

                As per the findings that has been identified from the essay is
                that mostly all except for one make use of qualitative research.
                Further, it can be determined that there are different set of
                strategies and programs that can be used in order to reduce or
                eliminate the causes of fall (Pynoos Steinman and Nguyen, 2010).
                Moreover, the fall issues are less to young people and even if
                they fall their body have that strength to recover the damage
                caused. On the other hand, old age people, if they fall then it
                may cause them serious issues and in most of the cases there are
                also chances of death.

              <span>
                From this finding, it can be articulated that implementation of
                fall prevention programmes are highly beneficial and they play
                vital role in reducing he impacts of fall (DiBardino, Cohen and
                Didwania, 2012). Most of the drops occur due to medical
                conditions that are faced by old people. The treatments to falls
                is highly expensive when compared with other issues that are
                caused. Fall can be reduced at great extent when the programs
                are implemented or applied effectively and efficiently.
