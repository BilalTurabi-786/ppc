                The topic for the dissertation is that how the modern movement
                in architecture has affected the field of architecture and what
                are the current challenges. The dissertation will talk about the
                effects of the modern architecture has brought in along with the
                challenges that came in modern movement in architecture. Whether
                the affects are positive or negative will be studied in the
                dissertation. The field of architecture is defined as the
                process that involves planning followed by designing and
                construction of buildings. The works of architecture in forms of
                materials is assumed to be as symbols and works of art. The term
                architecture is used to describe activities involved in
                construction (Kapitzke, 2006). It is considered to be as a
                science or an art both for describing buildings and other
                physical structure. Architecture is a term related to architect
                where services are rendered by professionals related to
                designing and constructing buildings. Planning and designing of
                buildings includes in it deciding upon ambience and space within
                and around them. Also, it includes to plan about all sorts of
                aesthetic and environmental considerations (Allison and Eshun,
                2006).

              <span>
                The modern movement in architecture has brought in a lot of
                changes in this field. The need of architecture is to creatively
                bring out newer and newer approaches and ideas for construction
                of buildings. Modern movement in architecture needs to
                manipulate and then properly coordinate available materials and
                technology. With the advancement of new and new technologies,
                there are more number of ways and reforms in the field of
                architecture. The field of architecture not only focuses on
                construction of building but also on estimation of cost related
                to various activities in it and their administration (Gehl,
                2007). Architects not only design buildings or other physical
                structures but also aims to visualize and imagine future which
                involve forecasting that how the building can sustain in future.
                It makes use of various aspects of mechanical and structural
                engineering along with humanities and arts in order to design
                and construct buildings and other physical structures.

                Modern movement in architecture was a movement which took place
                in the 1920s and is considered to be a dramatic shift in designs
                of buildings different from the traditional ones. The techniques
                in construction were now shifted towards a new era of designs
                from the past. It not only leads to the development of new
                designs but also formed new tools and techniques that can be
                employed in the buildings. With this movement, the architects
                started using steel and other manufacturing materials.

                and aims to find that whether modern movement has an effect on
                architecture and if it has then how it has been affected. The
                research questions are interesting and motivate the researcher
                as the study will result in understanding of how changes have
                taken place in the aspect of designing buildings. The topic of
                the particular study is relevant today because architecture is
                one such field which is growing continuously and more and more
                new designs are developing today. So it will be interesting to
                know about the developed designs which developed as a result of
                the modern movement.

                Earlier in the medieval period in Europe, the names of the
                architects of buildings remain unknown and it was not added
                against any of them. But then, a period came when craftsmen
                started to organize their own trades and through this their
                contacts were added and survived. After that in renaissance
                Europe, a revival took place and more emphasis was laid on how
                an individual contribute to the construction of buildings and
                the society as a whole (We and Dijkstra, 2010).

                Modern architecture is that form of architecture which has
                features that has made it superior to all other earlier forms in
                construction. This form ahs main features as of simplicity and

                The approach of modern arhcitecture is being adopted by modern
                architectural professionals and is one of the most dominant
                styles of architecture. Its main purpose was to use the
                materials and equipments in a rational manner and thereby
                rejecting the historical styles and ornaments (Modern
                architecture, 2013).

                The main features of modern architecture includes, firstly, that
                it followed the concept of ‘form follows function’ which means
                that a design should result into such that it could directly
                reveal the purpose of the building and its design.&nbsp;

            <p>
              <span>
                Another style is sustainable design which is based on the
                philosophy that all materials and objects to be used in
                construction shall be such that they are in compliance with
                economic and social sustainability. This is done in order to
                make use of sensitive designs in construction so that negative
                impact on the environment can be eliminated. Such type of
                buildings also aims to increase the connectivity of environment
                with people so that more and more meaningful innovations of this
                type can be created (Allen, 2000).

                A new form of architecture that leads to the benefits of
                architectures was novelty architecture. This is a type of
                approach in which buildings are given a unique or unusual shape
                which can be considered to be a landmark. These are used by the
                industries for advertising their products as they can resemble
                the products sold by them (Sibley, 2007).
