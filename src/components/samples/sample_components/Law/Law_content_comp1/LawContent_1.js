                s4-15 wherein all deductions are subtracted from the total

                Michael’s tax liability amounts to $122,000 (=$130,000-$8,000).
                This is only applicable for Michael as his wife is unemployed.

                business operated by Mary with a total turnover of $350,000 for
                the current financial year. It is assumed that Mary is a Cash
                Taxpayer. Since the total turnover value includes a component of
                Credit Sales worth $60,000, their revenue would only be taken
                into consideration for tax purpose when such debts are actually
                realised by Mary from&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;Receivables. The same
                applies for Interest payments realised worth $3,000 from the
                total of $8,000. Hence, the net turnover relevant for tax
                liability computation is $290,000 and Interest Payments received
                on overdue of customers is $3,000. Also, there are tax Thus, the
                total tax liability of Mary amounts to $65000
                (=$290,000+$8,000-$3,000-$230,000). Hence, the total tax payable

                          such an income would be included in their assessable

                          the prescribed threshold of $50 million, Rankin is
                          identified as a small business and it will be entitled
                          to a tax rate of 27.5%. Apart from this, the company
                          had a deductions totalling up to $6 million. Also, the

                          February 2000 for $800,000. Thus, a capital gain of
                          $300,000 (=$1,100,000-$800,000) is made by Rankin on
                          sale of their warehouse. As a result, the taxable
                          income for Rankin is $800,000
                          (=$6,500,000-$6,000,000+$300,000). Thus, the total tax
                          payable by the company will be $220,000
                          (=$800,000*27.5%)

                          <strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Michael Banner has applied
                          for a job in London and intends to leave Australia. As
                          there is no specific information provided in regards
                          to his return, it is assumed that he may leave the
                          country indefinitely. This evident with his decision
                          to sell almost all of his possessions that are owned
                          by him in Australia such as his car, paintings and a
                          flat. As per ITAA, 1997, it is crucial for the
                          taxpayer to be physically present in Australia for at
                          least some time. Since this is not true in case of
                          Michael, he will be treated as a Non-Resident of
                          Australia in future years. However, for the purpose of
                          taxing his income up to February 2016, Michael would
                          be considered as an Australian Resident as he has
                          never been outside of the country previously. He also
                          receives fully franked dividend worth $7,000 which can
                          be attributed as a tax credit that seeks to reduce
                          Michael’s overall tax burden by eliminating the
                          possibility of double taxation. Additionally, he was
                          entitled to be taxed as per the provisions of Capital
                          gains tax for the assets sold by him. This includes
                          sale of car which amounted to a total capital loss of
                          $12,000. Additionally, Michael sold some of the
                          paintings he possessed in the following fashion:

                          by Michael for more than 12 months, they are entitled
                          to a 50% discount as per CGT Rules prescribed by ITAA,
                          1997. Also, Michael sold his flat, which he initially
                          bought in 2009 for $450,000 and rented to someone
                          else, in January 2016 for $900,000. Here, the capital
                          gain of $450,000 would be considered as per section
                          118-192 of ITAA 1997. Thus, total taxable income of
