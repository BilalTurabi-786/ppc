                In UK the dairy industry is growing to a greater extent as they
                are having expertise for processing and distributing with the
                dairy products. They are known for there freshly pasteurised
                milk which is healthy for the humans (Gould, 2012). Thus, the
                industry highly focuses on the developing with high standards of
                production and coming up with new products to be served.
                Further, in this report detailed analysis of dairy industry is
                been done which assist includes the determination of competitive
                challenges and the opportunities which are faced by the
                industry.

                It is an efficient model which is highly been used to evaluate
                the external factors which have a great influence on the
                operations of the dairy industry (Industry Overview. 2015).
                Further, this industry is a sub-set of agricultural industry
                which means it involves the activities such as production, sale
                of milk products such as cheese, milk, cream, cheese etc. which
                provides with high satisfaction level to the customers. Further,
                there are number of factors which affects the dairy industry.
                Thus, following factors are as follows:

                    Political-&nbsp;The policies and regulations determined by
                    the government which are related to the dairy products has a
                    great influencer on the decisions made by the farmers for
                    keeping there livestock and producing with the products. If
                    the policies are in favour of promoting beef than the farmer
                    will slaughter the cow rather than keeping them for milk
                    (Ismail and Nielsen, 2010).

                  <span>
                    Economic-&nbsp;The most important element which highly
                    affects the dairy industry is the purchasing power of the
                    people in the&nbsp;economy. It is been seen that milk is an
                    considered as a basic thing which is purchased by every
                    individual irrespective of there purchasing power. Thus, it
                    can be concluded that the sales of this would not hit if the
                    income is low.

                    Sociological-&nbsp;In the present scenario, people are
                    shifting towards the vegan lifestyle which have a negative
                    effects on the sales of the dairy products. Moreover, people
                    are concerned about there weight so they are avoiding the
                    products as they are having greater amount of fat components
                    in them. Thus, the industry has to come up with low fat
                    products so as to retain there sales in the market.

                  <span>
                    Technological-&nbsp;This is an important factor which has
                    helped the dairy manufacturers to market the products to the
                    customers which assist them to increase with there sales
                    volume. Moreover, in the recent time, the farmers are
                    practising with different technological equipments which
                    ultimately increase the cost price of the products.

                    all the laws which are been determined for the production as
                    well marketing the products in the market. Further, it is
                    important to determine the ingredients and the expiry date
                    of the products so that no one is harmed by it.

                    Environmental-&nbsp;It is been clear that the whole dairy
                    industry is dependent on health and availability of
                    livestock (Law, Harvey and Reay, 2013). Thus, it is
                    important for the farmers to take several measures to keep
                    there livestock away from diseases so that it do not effect
                    there quality products. Moreover, the products must be
                    stored in a proper manner so that they do not loose there

                It is an important model which is used to analyse the different
                parameters of the industry which assist in developing the
                strategy for the business. Thus, under this there are mainly
                five factors which which affects the dairy industry. The
                following are been determined as under:

                  <span>
                    <strong>Threat of new entrants-</strong>&nbsp;In this
                    industry it requires with high amount of capital for making
                    the investments. Thus, it is not possible for people to
                    start with this and attain the economies of scale. So there
                    low degree of new entrants in the industry.

                </p>

                  <span>
                    <strong>Threat of substitutes-</strong>&nbsp;It is having a
                    medium degree of substitutes products in the industry. As in
                    the market there are large number of other substitutes for
                    the milk, thus it is important to focus on other dairy
                    products which will help to retain the competitiveness in
                    the industry (Papademas and Bintsis, 2010). This will also
                    result in increasing the profitability of the industry.
                    Moreover, the cost price of the products also vary from time
                    to time and as per the brand. This increases the degree to
                    substituting the products with others.

                    <strong>Bargaining power of buyer-</strong>&nbsp;In this
                    industry, there are large number of firms which are serving
                    with the similar products with different brands. Thus, it is
                    crucial for the organization to develop high quality and
                    unique products to gather the customers. Further, it is
                    clear that the bargaining power of customers is very high as
                    they are having number of options available with them.

                  <span>
                    <strong>Bargaining power of suppliers-</strong>&nbsp;As in
                    this industry the suppliers are mainly the farmer which are
                    serving with the milk to the companies for the final
                    products. Thus, the bargaining power is low in this case
                    (Robinson, 2012).

                    <strong>Rivalry among competitors-</strong>&nbsp;In the
                    industry there are large number of competitors which
                    includes big companies as well as the local people which are
                    serving with the same products to the customers. Thus, for
                    this industry there is high degree of competition level in
                    the market. Thus, it become important to maintain the
                    quality of the products so as to provide the customers with
                    efficient products which satisfy them to a greater extent.

            <p>
              <span>
                From the above report it can be concluded that the dairy
                industry is growing with the time but the needs and preferences
                of the people are changing on the regular basis. Thus, it
                becomes important for the organizations to evaluate there
                demands and develop with the products accordingly. Further, the
                micro as well as macro environmental factors have a great impact
                on the operations and sales of the dairy industry.

            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                By developing with the proper analysis of the market it is been
                recommended that the dairy industry must evaluate the different
                factors which mainly includes the micro and macro before
                developing with the strategies of the organization. Moreover,
                the policies which are followed by the competitors must also to
                be seen on regular basis so as to maintain image in the market.
                Further, they must evaluate with the opportunities which will
                help them to grow the industry to a greater level.
