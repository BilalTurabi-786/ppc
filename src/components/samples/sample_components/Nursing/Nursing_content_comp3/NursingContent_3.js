                  Nursing management can be determined as the performance
                  related to the function of leadership of decision making and
                  governance within the organization that is employing nurses.
                  Further, it included all the functions for management like
                  organizing, staffing, controlling, directing and planning.
                  There are different type of department that are handled by
                  nurses. Present report is based on a case of Joshua who born
                  within 29 weeks gestation and it was found that he has
                  respiratory distress. This report covers priorities
                  of&nbsp;nursing&nbsp;management admission to neonatal nursery.
                  Further, it covers short and long term complications of using
                  CPAP. Lastly, it also includes long term problems that Joshua
                  and his family will experience due to Joshua’s preterm birth.

                  There are different set of priorities that has to be followed
                  by nurses towards the patient. There are many immediate care
                  that has to be provided to new born baby. In this context,
                  below given are the five priorities that has to be followed:

                  <strong>Delivering proper care</strong>: There are different
                  type of requirements that a patient and their child need. It
                  is important to make sure that all type of services are being
                  delivered to them. In this context, it is the main priority
                  that all the information that is provided by patient is not
                  being disclosed to anyone (Cools, Offringa and Askie, 2015).
                  In this context, it essential that all the basic requirement
                  so that delivery can be conducted proper should be considered.
                  During delivery time, there are different type of
                  complications that can be caused and for each of the issues or
                  problems, it is important to consider that all things are
                  considered and adequate steps are taken with the help of which
                  complications can be reduced. Further, there should be
                  equipments and tools ready in can of emergency.

                  Health assessment:&nbsp;It is essential to conduct health
                  assessment. In this context, it includes test like blood
                  pressure, pulse rate, etc. For the baby, it is essential for
                  the nurse to make sure that all the muscle tone are correct.
                  Further, pulse rate should be checked. Moreover, colour of
                  skin, respiration, etc. should be considered. These are the
                  basic function that needs to be considered. When there are
                  issues in relation with any of the determined areas are
                  identified, then immediate steps should be taken so that
                  proper care can be provided. More specifically, there is score
                  that is given by nurses for each of the baby that is born
                  (Kirpalani, Millar and Roberts, 2013). It is given out of 10
                  and if it is 7 of more than that, then it is considered to be
                  normal. However, in cases if the score is give is between 4 to
                  6, then this shows that baby should be given with some
                  resuscitation measures and proper monitoring. In addition to
                  this, it the score is below 3, then immediate life saving
                  techniques and resuscitation should be given.

                  Physical examination: It is essential to conduct proper
                  physical examination in order to check the signs that there is
                  any type of issues that is identified in the new born baby. At
                  the time, baby is born, there are immediate steps that in
                  order to make sure that there is not serious issues that are
                  faced by the child. This generally take place within nursery
                  or delivery room but it depends upon the policies that are
                  followed in hospital (Overman, Liu and Moore, 2013). There are
                  different type of procedures that are followed and it includes
                  measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature.
                  Further, it includes measurement of length, head circumference
                  and weight. It enables to determine whether the growth is
                  normal or not. Special care is provided to babies who are born
                  underweight or are very large. Once the temperature of the
                  baby is stabilized, then they first bath is given. In addition
                  to this, footprints are taken for medical record.

                  Care to new born:&nbsp;All the babies are observed and those
                  who have normal weight and stabilized body temperature are
                  given bath immediately. On the other hand, child who has child
                  who are born premature are given special care and are kept
                  understand observation and care is provided according to their
                  requirement.

                  Monitoring and observation: At the time when child is kept at
                  CPAP, it is important that proper observation should be made
                  so that all the changes that taken place in child should be
                  observed (Sharma, Clark and Keszler, 2015). It is essential to
                  make sure that there is proper pressure maintained in CPAP so
                  that baby will be able to recover quickly.

                  In accordance with the case, it can be started that Joshua was
                  a premature baby and weighted 1200 grams. He had issues in
                  relation with respiration and so he was given CPAP. With this
                  respect, it is important to consider that the steps taken by
                  nurses at that point of time were right as the child needed
                  oxygen. In this context, positive pressure ventilation was
                  given and so that with time the child will be able to overcome
                  the problem of respiration after proper observation.

                  Three potential long or short term complications of using CPAP

                  CAPA (Continuous positive airway pressure) is a type of
                  positive airway pressure ventilator. This is helpful to apply
                  mild air pressure continuously so that person gets proper
                  oxygen. There are different type of long term complications
                  that are faced by the use of CPAP. In this context, below
                  given are three long term complications:
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Bloody nose: This is one of the long term complication that is
                  faced due to CPAP during preterm birth. Further, there is not
                  fixed time in which a person’s nose can bleed. In this, there
                  is not pain felt but excess loss of blood causes blood lose
                  and haemoglobin rate within body (Greenough, Murthy and
                  Sundaresan, 2016). Their cases in which it becomes difficult
                  to stop bleeding and it causes serious health issues for the
                  person. Further, it is difficult to find out that main reason
                  due to which type of issue is caused. When CPAP is given, then
                  mouth and nose is covered with mask and when the pressure of
                  oxygen is not properly stabilized as per requirement, then it
                  affects nose and this causes a reason for nose bleeding.

                <span>
                  Breathing problems: Lungs gets affected when CPAP is given.
                  The respiratory system also gets negatively affects. There are
                  cases in which patient is not able to perform physical
                  exercise and when such activities are performing, then it
                  becomes difficult to breath and this result in
                  unconsciousness. To perform any type of role, it requires
                  proper concentration and when body fails to breath in enough
                  oxygen, then it creates issues so as to complete the work
                  effectively. It is essential to inhale enough oxygen so that
                  body functioning can be operated effectively. It is important
                  to make oxygen reach all part of the body. However, there are
                  cases in which due to CPAP used during preterm birth increases
                  the rate of issues related to breathing.

                  Stomach problem: Due to CPAP machine, there are cases in which
                  it causes stomach pain and bloating. This type of issue arises
                  as the air pressure that is set on the machine make it pump
                  high pressure of air into the mask (Szyld, Aguilar and&nbsp;
                  Musante, 2014). This is caused when nurses do not take proper
                  care to adjust with sleep specialist. Stomach problems creates
                  issue for digestion when anything that is consumed causes pain
                  and it also creates issue for taking food inside.

                  There are different strategies that are implemented in order
                  to make sure that the rate of negative impact is reduced that
                  is caused because of CPAP. In this context, during the
                  situation of preterm birth, it is important that there is
                  proper monitoring done of the baby. There are cases in which
                  serious issues can cause to the child if the pressure is more
                  compared with the required one (Cools, Offringa and Askie,
                  2015). In order words, it requires real time monitoring
                  enables to reduce the risk of lung damage. Further, protective
                  strategy is used by nurses in order to make sure that the rate
                  of lung damages caused by CPAP can be reduced. When a child
                  like Joshua is place in CPAP, then it is important that there
                  is proper monitoring so that in case of any emergency
                  situation or problems can be reduced.

                  There are different type of problems that can be faced by
                  Joshua and his family due to Joshua’s preterm birth. In this
                  context, below given are four of the potential long term
                  problems:&nbsp;
                  <strong>Intellectual and developmental disabilities</strong>:
                  With age there are certain growth that occurs to a child. In
                  this context, it includes physical and mental development.
                  However, when child like Joshua who had premature birth have
                  difficulties in physical development (Kirpalani, Millar and
                  Roberts, 2013). Further, there are issues in relation with
                  learning thing which normally same age children can perform.
                  Moreover, it becomes difficult to have proper communication
                  with other. It is important to have proper interaction with
                  for the family of Joshua but it becomes difficult for them to
                  understand or also difficult for Joshua to make them
                  understand regrading the thing that he wants to convey.
                  Further, children with premature birth prefer to be alone and
                  do not get easily adjusted with others. Further, the basic
                  things that a child can perform of the same age of Joshua but
                  he can find it difficult for the same. Further, there are also
                  conditions in which the growth of any one of the body part can
                  get affected.&nbsp;<strong>Autism</strong>: This is a type of
                  behavioural disorder. In this child gets affected with
                  behavioural, social and speech. This has negative impact over
                  brain, spinal cord and nerves. It becomes difficult for the
                  child to perform basic activities and in having proper
                  communication with others (Overman, Liu and Moore, 2013).
                  There are conditions in which parents also does not have
                  proper information about it and they fail to make sure that
                  proper care is being provided to them. This is a type of
                  disease that does not have proper care. However, the only
                  thing that can be done is to reduce the negative impact by
                  therapies. It becomes difficult to have a social life as in
                  autism it becomes to make other understand.&nbsp;
                  <strong>Lung problem</strong>: One of the disease that is
                  caused when lungs gets affected is Asthma. It is a type of
                  condition that affects the airways and increases breathing
                  problems. Breathing problems affects social life and it is
                  important to have continuous meditation so that the rate of
                  issues can be solved. Further, there is another type of lung
                  related issues that is caused among premature babies that is
                  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are chances that
                  Joshua can get affected with this type of disease (Sharma,
                  Clark and Keszler, 2015). As per this lung disease, it causes
                  lungs to grow abnormally or to be inflamed. With time this
                  type of issue get reduced but the chances of getting asthma is
                  high and it their symptoms remains throughout their
                  life.&nbsp;<strong>Heath problems</strong>: Joshua is at high
                  risk to have health related problems. In this context, it
                  includes intestinal problems this is generally caused to
                  premature babies who are also known as necrotizing
                  enterocolitis. This is a type of disease that affects
                  intestine of babies. Intestine is body function that help to
                  break down food. Majority of child who are premature overcome
                  the problems of intestine but for most of them it stays for
                  life long. Further, it also causes different type of
                  infections like meningitis that is a type of infection which
                  caused in brain. Further, it includes pneumonia a type of
                  infection which is caused in lungs. Moreover, premature babies
                  also face problem of vision (Greenough, Murthy and Sundaresan,
                  2016). In this context, it induces diseases like retinopathy
                  of prematurity. In addition to this, it also includes dental
                  problem and hearing loss.

                  should be provided to parents related with the health issues
                  that are being faced. Further, it is important to have
                  effective&nbsp;communication so that there is strong
                  relationship developed among nurses and patient. This way
                  trust and confidence is developed. Moreover, nurses has to
                  take immediate actions at the time of delivery as what type of
                  issue can take place is not fixed. Further, there are certain
                  steps and procedures that has to be followed by nurses and all
                  those should be considered. When the temperature is
                  stabilized, then new born baby should be given bath
