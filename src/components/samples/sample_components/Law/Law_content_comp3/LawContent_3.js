                  On accordance to the first scenario Rosso, who is residing
                  abroad, enter into a contract with Sparkles for cleaning the
                  house in the city and in pursuance to the same makes available
                  the key of concerned place on 15th January 2016. However,
                  after some time when Rosso returns, to his shock, he finds the
                  entire house in mess. He discovers that the entire place was
                  filed with dust and his belongings were broken into pieces.
                  Apart from others, one of the most valuable possessions of
                  Rosso, an antique desk, was also found broken. It has been
                  ascertained that the desk alone shall require repairs worth
                  $10,000. In accordance to the facts it has been ascertained
                  that there was a clear breach of contract from the end of
                  service providers. Moreover, another issue which is raised in
                  the situation is that Sparkles Ltd. Operated to provide
                  cleaning services only that are elderly and surviving on the
                  basis of pensions. Hence, whether the action of company can be
                  considered as ultra vires to the object mentioned in the
                  memorandum or Rosso shall be entitled to claim damages..

                                  In accordance to&nbsp;law, it is stated that
                                  the advertisement published by Sparkles was
                                  misleading and deceptive in nature. In order
                                  to establish the nature of misleading it is
                                  imperative for the parties to establish that
                                  one of the parties was induced to enter into
                                  the contractual relation on the basis of false
                                  impressions. It is an established law that the
                                  parties can terminate the contract if any of
                                  the elements of contract are not fulfilled or
                                  the parties breach the terms of the contract.
                                  In addition, to these factors there exist
                                  various vitiating factors which amount to be a
                                  valid ground for avoiding a contract in a
                                  lawful manner. Misleading and deceptive
                                  practices are one such vitiating factor which
                                  allows the aggrieved party to repudiate the
                                  contract. Moreover, Australian Consumer Law
                                  clearly states prohibitions in respect to the
                                  misleading or deceptive actions of business
                                  enterprises. Moreover, the court in Miller
                                  &amp; Associates Insurance Broking v BMW
                                  Australia Finance stated that silence shall be
                                  considered as misleading only in the event
                                  there arise a duty of disclosure on the
                                  concerned party. This doctrine imposes a
                                  strict liability offence on one of the parties
                                  who has in fact acted in a wrongful manner.
                                  Moreover, it has also been held by the court
                                  in Perre v. Apand Pty. Ltd (1998) that the
                                  intention of conduct shall not matter as long
                                  as there exists scope to protect the interests
                                  of the claimant. Hence, if the claimant has
                                  relied on the misleading or deceptive
                                  statement/conduct of a corporate and entered
                                  into any form of relation, then a strict
                                  liability shall be imposed on the wrongdoer.
                                  The primary rationale which supports the
                                  application of this rule is that any entity
                                  making a representation is in a higher
                                  position to know the authenticity of
                                  information being represented. In pursuance to
                                  the same, law places complete onus on the
                                  person making the representation. It has been
                                  opined by court in many cases that though this
                                  rule is in contradiction to the traditional
                                  principle of caveat emptor, it is considered
                                  to be more fair and just in nature. Further,
                                  in the case of HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty
                                  Ltd. Astonland Pty Ltd. (2004) it was also
                                  established by the court that the claim under
                                  cses of misleading and deceptive conduct shall
                                  be allowed only in the instances the claimant
                                  has in fact received quantifiable loss which
                                  is economic in nature. In addition, the case
                                  of Butcher v. Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd.
                                  (2004) also states that entities shall ensure
                                  that advertising claims as well as information
                                  shall not be in any form misleading or
                                  deceptive in nature. It shall be considered as
                                  a clear violation of Section 52 contained in
                                  the Trade Practices Act 1974. Light and Bulb
                                  and for this reason he has been offered such a
                                  deal. In pursuance to the same, Dennis enters
                                  into a contractual relation with Sparkles,
                                  which contained the standard terms of the
                                  entity. Dennis made the payments for March and
                                  April bills as and when received by him.
                                  However, the bill for month of May received by
                                  Dennis was in the name Glitters. When enquired
                                  he was informed that only the of entity has
                                  been changed. Hence, Dennis makes the
                                  requisite payments. Further, in the next month
                                  the same incident is repeated and this time
                                  the bill was in the name of Twinkles.
                                  Completely distressed from repetition of the
                                  situation, Dennis decided to terminate the
                                  contract with Sparkles and approach Light and
                                  Bulb for availing their services again.
                                  However, on July 15, 2016, after being
                                  informed about termination, the
                                  representatives of Twinkles communicate that
                                  Dennis has acted in breach of the terms and
                                  hence is liable for payment of $685 in the
                                  form of termination fees. In furtherance to
                                  the same, Dennis receives a letter from the
                                  company with a demand of $900. It is important
                                  to state that Cleaning Industry of the nation
                                  is under an obligation to abide by all
                                  practices mentioned in the Code of Practice
                                  within the industry. The code of practice
                                  provides for a set of behaviour which shall be
                                  considered reasonable and proper in nature. In
                                  accordance to one of the clauses every
                                  contractor is required to notify the client
                                  before transferring their services to another
                                  supplier. Another common law factor which has
                                  the capacity to vitiate the contract in its
                                  totality is the factor of undue influence. In
                                  pursuance to the same, the defendant party
                                  generally makes an improper use of their
                                  position in order to acquire contractual
                                  benefits or induce the other person in to a
                                  contractual relationship, so that the consent
                                  of such a person cannot be considered to have
                                  received voluntarily. In the event it is
                                  established that there was presence of the
                                  vitiating factors in the form of duress or
                                  undue influence, the aggrieved shall be
                                  entitled to rescind the contract. In the case
                                  of Commercial Bank of Australia v. Amadio
                                  (1983) it was opined that rescinding the
                                  contract is distinct from terminating it as
                                  the former makes the contract void ab initio
                                  and does not make available any form of
                                  contractual remedy. On the other hand
                                  termination is merely ending the contractual
                                  relation at the very point and does not make
                                  it void ab intio, thereby enabling the parties
                                  to make use of contractual remedies. One of
                                  the renowned Australian case in the name of
                                  Johnson v. Buttress (1936) it was opined by
                                  the court that undue influence can be either
                                  in an actual form or presumed undue influence
                                  where it can be deemed that the concerned
                                  party occupied such a relationship which had
                                  the capacity to influence the decision of
                                  aggrieved party. In addition, in pursuance to
                                  the contract formulated between the parties,
                                  i.e. Dennis and Sparkles (now represented by
                                  Twinkes), every service receiver had the right
                                  to terminate the contract after giving a
                                  written or oral notice to the contractor. This
                                  is an express term which has been mutually
                                  agreed by the both the parties and clearly
                                  mentioned in all the standard contracts of
                                  Sparkle Ltd. In pursuance to the same it can
                                  be stated that Biff by acknowledging the
                                  association of Dennis with Light and Bright,
                                  and making the offer of low price if he agrees
                                  to sign a contract for 3 years. In such a
                                  situation Biff influenced the decision of
                                  Dennis as he erroneously considered him
                                  associated with Light and Bright. It is
                                  important to consider that in the event Dennis
                                  was know to the fact that Biff belonged to
                                  some other company he might not have consented
                                  for the agreement, as he was a loyal client of
                                  Light and Bright. In light of the same it can
                                  be stated that Dennis was empowered by
                                  contract law to rescind the contract.
                                  Moreover, the standard terms in contract also
                                  empowered Dennis to terminate the contract by
                                  giving a oral or written notice. This
                                  condition has also been fulfilled by Dennis
                                  and thus, the action of Dennis cannot be
                                  considered as breach of the contract. Hence,
                                  in pursuance to the same Dennis was under no
                                  obligation to make payments in the form of
                                  termination fees. In accordance to the third
                                  scenario Ted, owner of Australian Phones Pty.
                                  Ltd, is under a negotiation of a contract with
                                  solicitor Belinda. Soon after Ted is
                                  hospitalized and undergoes a heart surgery.
                                  Belinda visits the hospital and asks Ted to
                                  sign the contract, on failure of which she
                                  shall not represent Australian Phones Ltd.
                                  Belinda leaves the contract on the bed side
                                  and while walking out meets wife of Ted, Jan.
                                  Ted at that moment asks Jan to go through the
                                  contract. However, Jan has no university
                                  degree and her understanding of the contract
                                  cannot be considered as reliable. Ted who has
                                  just undergone the surgery, signs the contract
                                  relying on the opinion of Jan. After passage
                                  of 2 months, when Australian Phones win the
                                  case Ted refuses to transfer the shares to
                                  Belinda, as mentioned in the contract.
