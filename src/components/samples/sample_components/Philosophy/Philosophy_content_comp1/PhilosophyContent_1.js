                When knowledge is declared or expressed in a characteristic form
                of indicative propositions then it is called as descriptive or
                declarative knowledge. For completing a particular task or
                assignment in the field of project management, the researcher
                requires certain knowledge which provides an insight in all the
                aspects. When knowledge of “know-how” is produced in a
                descriptive format then it is referred as propositional
                knowledge. It is quite fascinating to explore the possibilities
                of intelligence or knowledge when backed by truth provides a
                defensible way or not. The theories which deal with methods and
                validity of knowledge, followed by its scope is known as
                epistemology. There are different types of knowledge amongst
                which propositional knowledge holds a major inclination. The
                other variations of knowledge.

                Personal knowledge is referred to as acquiring intellectual
                information through acquaintance and procedural knowledge is
                based completely on the process or technique with which a task
                or activity can be accomplished. On the other hand,
                propositional knowledge is completely different. It refers to
                the knowledge which depicts specific claims. For instance, I
                know that concerned project will be completed in two months.
                Knowledge basically reflects the understanding ability of a
                person. It can also be considered as the measure of being aware
                regarding a topic or subject. The individual that has personal
                knowledge is said to have propositional knowledge in some form.
                However, the vice versa situation is not necessary to exist.
                Several philosophers and researchers have depicted that all the
                three types of knowledge are interlinked and major epistemology
                has clear depiction of propositional knowledge.&nbsp;
                <strong>Difficulties in the perspective and examples</strong>
                &nbsp;It is often claimed that propositional knowledge majorly
                consists of true beliefs which are further supported with
                respective justifications. Great philosophers have classified
                propositional knowledge as the kind of ability which provides
                claims regarding proficiency in a subject. For instance,
                the&nbsp;project management&nbsp;is a strategic tool which
                involves all the attributes related with a project irrespective
                of the area of application. The planning tool requires concerned
                manager to be able to separate activities according to their
                priorities and then place them in the time scale. If a person
                claims that Gantt chart depicts the time scale of a project.
                Then it definitely refers to a propositional knowledge of the
                person. Considering another example: when a person states that
                he is aware about the objectives of plan then that person is
                actually claiming to posses propositional knowledge. True
                beliefs can be stated as truths only when they are supported or
                backed by appropriate evidences. These become a proof that the
                concerned fact or truth does exists and the fact stated by
                concerned individual holds certain type of validity.
                Epistemology is considered as an important part of the series
                based on philosophy. Great thinkers like Aristotle, Buddha,
                Plato, Kant, etc. had their philosophies in the epistemology. It
                can be considered as the study or research which comprises of
                justifications and knowledge that are aligned with rational
                beliefs. Any sort of knowledge can be considered as the same
                with validity and reliability in consideration, when there is
                justification, truth and belief. Scope of knowledge is also
                depicted through this understanding. A great difference can be
                experienced between knowing a concept and having an
                understanding of the operation or technique which needs to be
                followed. Furthermore, knowledge is also considered to be known
                through some relation or metaphorical capabilities. The
                conceptual knowledge can be utilised in application only when it
                is supported by certain type of justification. Similar can be
                considered as the case of propositional knowledge. If a person
                makes certain claims, then it can be contemplated as truth with
                help of respective justifications or proofs. Foundational-ism is
                one of the philosophical thesis which portrays the structuring
                of justification. One can understand this concept with help of
                the following example. If a person states that there is use of
                only internet based or online resources for the concerned
                project. Then it determines that the person justifiably believes
                that only online resources will be useful and no other source
                shall be required in the entire execution. The foundational
                justification of knowledge cannot be standardised proof but it
                justified in a sense that concerned fact does exists in the
                propositional form. Sufficient amount of valid reasons are
                required for developing a belief of propositional knowledge.
                There are two more theoretical concepts which can be considered
                for defying the statement that “knowledge comprises a true
                belief backed by a justification”. These include
                internalism-externalism. Internalism consists of the factors
                which are limited to the internal attributes of a person. On the
                other hand, externalism provides that justification for
                knowledge is completely based on the external and additional
                components which are experienced by the individual. This is
                quite a conflicting scenario. Often knowledge and belief are
                considered to be same. Belief can be stated as one’s faith in a
                subject or element irrespective of the fact whether it is backed
                by truth and justification. However, knowledge is a valid
                factual data always supported by appropriate justifications.
                When difficulties arise in this perspective then the issues are
                considered to be Gettier cases and Gettier problems (Hintikka,
                2016). Despite of the fact that these require subsequent
                discussions in context of true belief and knowledge, but
                internal aspects of the person are expressed to be sufficient in
                justifying the knowledge. The major consequence which is
                experienced in the perspective acquired is the acquisition of
                belief. The claim made by one person may or may not be
                acceptable to other individual. For instance, projects hold many
                things at stake. The propositional knowledge turns out to be
                insufficient when decisions on budget, resources and time
                management have to be taken. If internalism is considered to be
                the only base on judging the decisions and knowledge then
                definitely conflicts might arise. Gettier problems will be
                addressed by the entire team. However, externalism depicts that
                knowledge is a particular thing which is justified in its own
                way. Additionally, if there is a requirement of justification
                then internal factors cannot be contemplated solely. This is a
                sort of epistemological issue which can be clarified with help
                of an amalgamation of the internal and external factors. When
                investigating the application of these concepts in project
                management, it is best suited to deal with facts that have
                justification so that they can be classified as propositional
                knowledge. It not only strengthens the view point of respective
                person but supports wide range application of the acquired
                knowledge and respective claims.

              <span>
                Philosophical judgements are always contemplated to be
                non-justifiable and self-sufficient. Epistemology though
                provides clear ideas about the truth and beliefs which are
                composed in propositional knowledge. It is inferred from the
                above understandings that propositional knowledge is a sort of
                claim which is made by the speaker. This knowledge is a true
                belief which is internally known to the person who possesses it
                but is also supported by valid justification. Although it is
                quite difficult to have a belief on a belief which is formed by
                the internal factors of an individual but this foundation has
                been due to existence of valid justification somewhere in the
                conscious. Hence, the clarification of propositional knowledge
                as a justified true belief is not so clear but very much valid
                when project management field is contemplated.
