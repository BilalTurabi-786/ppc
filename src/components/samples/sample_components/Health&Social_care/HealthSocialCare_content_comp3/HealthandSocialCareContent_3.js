                  Health care system includes a range of organizations,
                  individuals, businesses and resources that provide health care
                  services to the target consumers. Main objective of it is to
                  fulfill the health and care needs of people (Rogers, 2011).
                  Health care system plays a major role in maintaining the
                  health standards of country. In the present report, critical
                  analysis and comparison of health care system of UK and US
                  have been done. This report also highlights the similarities
                  and differences of health care system in between these two
                  countries. Further, quality of services, sources of funding
                  and various implications of health care system will be
                  demonstrated.

                  World health organization is a global body that is concerned
                  with maintaining the health standards and public health at the
                  global level. According to world health organization, UK is
                  ranked at 9th level for providing superior quality of health
                  care services. However, US lies on 17th rank for providing
                  prime health care services to its target population
                  (International comparison of health care system, 2004).
                  Further, US is taking significant steps to improve its rank in
                  the categories of health care system. For this aspect, US is
                  increasing its government spending on health care sector.
                  Therefore, both the countries; US and UK are doing intense
                  research and development to develop new medical technologies.
                  This has led to origination of cancer therapy, organ
                  transplantation, artificial organ implantation etc.

                  Main similarity between health care services of UK and US is
                  that both countries take funds from public and private sectors
                  to improve and develop health care sector. Further, government
                  of both countries spend the amount collected from different
                  sectors in bettering health care system, developing medical
                  technology, introducing lifesaving drugs etc. According to
                  OECD, total expenditure of UK on health care system was 8.3%
                  of their GDP whereas, US expenditure was estimated at 15.3% of
                  their GDP. This further states that US is incurring more
                  expenditure on gross total and per capita on the health care.
                  Health care industry of UK gets 85.5% funds from government
                  funding. However, the ratio of private sector contribution is
                  14.5% only (Comparative analysis of UK and US health care
                  system, 2007). Further, tax paid by public is mostly used by
                  government for improving the health care of UK citizens.
                  Contribution of public sectors in the health care system is
                  more in UK. Therefore, government funding is more on health
                  care rather than private bodies. NHS is a regulatory body of
                  UK that is regulated by government to provide cost efficient
                  health care services to target population. NHS is ranked among
                  world’s best health care system. Therefore, it provides
                  services at minimum cost and most of its services are free.
                  Along with this,it provides access to use health care
                  facilities and resources to all the residents of UK. Private
                  sector contributes more on health care system in US rather
                  than its public sector. There are many private bodies as well
                  as organizations that provide health care facilities. However,
                  cost of service provided by private sector organization is
                  more as compared to public sector. Thereafter, insurance
                  companies of US contributes a significant amount of funds to
                  the development of health care sector. In this aspect, health
                  care system of US is developed through funds generated from
                  the insurance purchased by target population (Gerardi, 2008).

                  Since, it has been identified that contribution of government
                  to health care sector is more in UK as compared to US. On the
                  contrary, private sector contributes more in US. NHS provides
                  cost efficient services to the residents of country. However,
                  quality of service provided in US is less effective as most of
                  the services are provided free (Dickinson, 2014). NHS involves
                  trust and local organizations that provide primary health care
                  facilities to poor and mediocre. Thereafter, most of health
                  care services in UK are provided by the private bodies. In
                  addition to this aspect, cost and quality of services in UK is
                  more effective. While, government of US possesses innovative
                  medical technology, highly qualified and experienced staff,
                  and large number of health institutions that help in providing
                  superior quality of services to patients. Thereafter,
                  government of both the countries are trying to reduce the
                  expenditure on health care system upto the sustainable level.
                  Therefore, cost of expenditure on health care should not be
                  more than the contribution in GDP (Flynn, 2013).

                  Health care in US is provided by different organizations such
                  as private, public and charitable. Therefore, 58% services are
                  provided by public bodies, 21% by trust and rest by the
                  government. However in UK more than 75% services are provided
                  by NHS and rest is provided by private bodies. In UK, proper
                  monitoring of organization in health care system and resource
                  allocation are done by the government bodies. There are
                  different types of trusts that help government in attaining
                  its objective of effective health care services such as
                  primary care, acute trust, ambulance trust and care trust.
                  Here, primary health care trust involves dentists, pharmacist
                  etc that provide primary health services while, acute trust
                  involves NHS and government hospitals etc. Further, ambulance
                  trust includes local bodies that handle emergency situations
                  while care trust involves the organization which provides
                  services to those individuals whose treatment is complex
                  (Burau and Blank, 2006). Hence, it can be said that
                  organization structure of UK is more comprised of government
                  bodies and US structure consist of private organizations.

              <p>
                <span>
                  From the above report, it can be concluded that health care is
                  a growing sector of UK and US. Health care of UK is mostly
                  depended on the funds generated by government
                  from&nbsp;taxation&nbsp;while, US health care system relies
                  more on funding through insurance companies and private
                  bodies. Thereafter, US government provides better quality of
                  services as compared to UK government. Therefore, satisfaction
                  level regarding health care services is more in case of US
                  citizens.
