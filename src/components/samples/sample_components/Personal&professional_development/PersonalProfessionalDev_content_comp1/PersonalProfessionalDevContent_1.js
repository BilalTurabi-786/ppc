                There are various competitors of firm i.e. Asda, Tesco that are
                offering high quality products or services at minimum prices so
                that it gives tough competition to rivals. Thus, overcome such

              <span>The main reasons of decline in sales of firm</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span>
                According to the view of Kirilenko, Kyle and Tuzun, (2017)it is
                stated that there are various reason of declined in sales which
                lead to impact the profitability of an organization. Sales of
                product can be declined because it not fulfils the needs and
                demand of customer. If company fail in making product and
                services as per taste and preference of consumer, then it
                directly impacts sale. In modern era, needs and demand of people
                change with change in time. They look out for new things instead
                of going on with existing product. Needs and demand of people
                increases time to time and it makes difficult for an
                organization to fulfil the needs and wants of time. This
                decrease the satisfaction level of customer and they switch to
                other brand product in respect to fulfil their needs and wants.
                Further, there are many competitors in retail industry who make
                similar type of products for customer and sale them at lower
                pricer. Increase in competition level also impact the sale of
                specific organization. Moreover, to survive in competitive
                market firm need to lower the price of its product and services
                which impact the profit of an organization. Therefore, increase
                in competition level also decline sale which directly impact
                profit of a company. Pouliot and Babcock, (2016) explained that
                if an organization not use effective marketing strategy then it
                also decreases the sale. Company make different type of product
                and services for its customer, but it need to ensure that
                customer know about its product and services or not. Moreover,
                if company not make its customer aware about product and
                services which they are selling then people will not prefer to
                buy them. As, it can be stated that people prefer to buy popular
                brand product. So ineffective marketing strategy also impact the
                sale of organization which directly impact the profitability.
                Furthermore, if company not make good quality of product and
                services then customer may not wish to buy particular firm
                product and services. It is important for an organization to
                focus on quality of product as customer mainly prefer to quality
                at the time of buying product and services.

                According to the view of Feletto, Burton and Egger, (2017)
                decline in sale lead to impact the profitability of an
                organization. If sale is declined then it impacts profit because
                company make product for its customer and if they not buy
                product and services then it impact sale. Some time company
                invest huge fund in making high quality product and services and
                attractive packaging. Further if people not like to but those
                products then company cannot recover its making charges and
                unable to make profit. Along with this organization also invest
                huge expenses in marketing its product and services but due to
                high price of product customer avoid buying those expensive
                product may decrease the profit of an organization. Increase in
                level of competition also diver the mind of customer in buying
                particular company product and services. There are more choice
                available for shopper and different company provide discount
                offer to its customer which grab the attention of large number
                of customers. This impact sale as well as profit of other
                organization. Furthermore, if sale is not increase then company
                cannot make profit to pay salary and wages to its employees.
                Therefore, it can be stated that sale is very important for an
                organization in order to make huge profit.

              <span>
                Guo and Xiong, (2016) explained that there are different
                strategies which company can adopt in order to increase sale and
                make huge profit. One of the effective strategy which an
                organization can used is effective marketing techniques. Through
                this company can easily enhance the sale of its product and
                services. Further it supports in making aware people about the
                product and services. Company can use modern marketing
                techniques such as social networking site. Through the help of
                this company can easily target large number of customer in less
                time. Company can provide detail information of its product on
                social networking site for grabbing the attention of large
                number of customer. Furthermore, there are many advance
                technology which can be used for making innovative product and
                services for its customer. If company used new technology and
                make product which were different from its competitor, then it
                can easily increase sale. Further, if products are different
                from its competitor then company can easily keep high price of
                its product because then it has less competitor. This assist
                organization in making huge profit. As pre view of
                Mohammadtalebi, Nasr and Mohammadtalebi, (2016) a company can
                make product and services focus on fulfilling the needs and
                demand of its customer in order to overcome decline of sale. For
                this purpose, firm can conduct marker research for identifying
                the needs and demand of its customer and focus on making product
                according to the taste and preference of customer. With the
                changes in time needs and demand of people also changes, through
                the help of market research company can easily in identify the
                needs of people and fulfils it. Further if firm get product as
                per their needs and want then they will not switch to other
                brand. Apart from this Company need to ensure that product and
                services which they are making is of good quality and grab the
                attention of people. This overall increase sale as well as
                profit of an organization.

                that leads to decline the ratio of sales in Sainsbury; hence
                according to the research aim, researcher has used various
                primary and secondary sources (Wirtz, 2012). Herein, this
                section provides detailed analysis about the information
                collected from primary and secondary both the sources. Since,
                books, journals and articles are being accessed in the research

                company’s profitability aspect is reducing (Stahlberg and Maila,
                2013). On the basis of secondary research, it is also
                ascertained that employees are required to focus on enhancing
                the service provision dimension so that it can have a direct
                impact on company’s profitability and success facets. This can
                be supported with an example which states that customers always
                prefer to purchase products from those business entities which
                are highly focused on quality dimension (Siu, 2012). However,
                currently the sales ratio of Sainsbury also seems to reduce
                because somewhere Sainsbury is not meeting all the quality
                dimensions. Apart from this, the use of primary source also
                depicts that Sainsbury is losing its market share because the
                business has been focusing on multiple services which not only
                impacts the sales; but also disturbs other operations.
