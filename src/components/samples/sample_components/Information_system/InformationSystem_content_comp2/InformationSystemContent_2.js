                Galliers and Leidner (2014) in his study stated that innovation
                brings out several opportunities for companies such as they can
                enhance their productivity in more effective manner. It is a
                user friendly technique comes with several solutions as well.
                Cloud based technology is being used more extensively by
                business from SMEs to larger enterprises. There are varieties of
                solutions provided to companies by which they can address the

                difficulties faced by them such as improper installation of set
                up as well as several security messages. Technical experts can
                review the problems faced by them and at the same time try to
                resolve those problems. According to Sosinsky (2010) customers
                are considered to be most important parts of any organization.
                In order to retain them it is quite essential to maintain better
                relationship with them. By the way of using CRM system companies
                can remains close with their consumers by maintaining proper
                coordination. According to that case study which is found the
                Article of Brodie and Mylopoulos (2012) most of the companies
                are facing problems such as&nbsp;Shortfalls in complex
                processing,&nbsp;Security issues,&nbsp;No-long term
                strategy,&nbsp;Lack of guidance etc. Some of the major
                challenges faced by companies using CRM are as follows:

            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Shortfalls in complex processing</strong>: Most of the
                time technical expertise are facing difficulties in managing
                interaction with consumers as well as advanced workflows.
                According to that case study which is found the Article of Wang,
                Noe and Wang (2014) HSBC bank is maintaining their consumer’s
                data by using CRM system. Due to the increasing number of
                customers they requires to maintain all their customer’s account
                related information as well as personal information. HSBC is
                serving their business operations worldwide and they might face
                difficulties at the time of managing advanced workflows due to
                the huge number of customers. For this, it is essential to take
                several measures such as they need to recruit highly talented
                and technical expert staff. In addition to this, only few
                entries need to be made in a single day in order to do not
                overload the data.

                <strong>Security issues</strong>: It is considered as a major
                problem that might face at the time of implementation of any
                software. In order to maintain proper installation it is quite
                essential to considered heightened security issues. Most of the
                firms using cloud based CRM system are using
                software-as-a-service (SaaS) security software. In addition to
                this, in the case study which has been founded from the article
                of Motro and Smets (2012) Fcaebook Googl+, Gmail are the major
                organizations using this software and maintaining data security
                and protecting all the confidential information of customers as
                well. However, there are various CRM solution providers which
                also provide high-end security to their customers and offer them
                several advanced data backup policies as well. It is the best
                way through which companies can gain trust among customers.
                Still, it is a major challenge for company that if there any
                type of problem exists in the system, then it negatively affects
                the customers.

                <strong>No-long term strategy</strong>: CRM solution is still a
                tremendous obstacle for too many companies. It is a business
                process change and there is a tendency to look to technology
                when it requires change. As per the case study given in the
                article of Wang, Noe and Wang (2014) it has been founded that
                HSBC bank can can align their business process to meet specific
                goals and various other issues like job roles and
                responsibilities, accountability as well as incentives (Brodie
                and Mylopoulos, 2012). These are the major factors which
                commonly requires for CRM to succeed. In addition to this, there
                should be a team which can impart that change is effective.
                There must be a process which defines that how CRM system will
                help the employees.

                <strong>Lack of guidance</strong>: Most of the companies build
                CRM system within their firm without a bearing wall.&nbsp;
                Further, it can be stated that a CRM initiative without goals
                will collapse and it requires setting a proper goal for company.
                According to the case study which is found in the article of
                Cook (2008) HSBC is creating a phased implementation plan before
                constructing CRM area into their business operations (Petkovic,
                2010). Without going through any of the guidance organizations
                are implementing CRM. Later it might create several
                difficulties.

            <p>
              <span>
                In order to overcome with all the above given difficulties it is
                essential for companies to take several measures such as: As per
                the case study which is found in the article Galliers and
                Leidner (2014) HSBC need to embrace CRM solution a prerequisite
                for realizing the set vision of bank, not just as a technology
                solution. At the end of the day it is necessary to collect all
                the necessary information in order to get on-going support.
                Highly advanced and experienced technical expertise need to be
                recruited within different IT firms. It is another most
                effective way to maintain the appropriate solution of the used
                CRM system. In order to overcome with the problem lack of
                guidance it is necessary for the project leader to start by
                crafting a valid business case for CRM before launching any of
                the new projects. They can also include the automating process
                that helps in improving user productivity and streamlining all
                the marketing and sales process. In order to overcome with the
                security issues it is necessary for them to adopt some of the
                best security software’s.

                Wang (2014) Enterprise 2.0 is the most effective and fundamental
                tool by which organizations can improve the collaboration.
                Enterprise 2.0 can be defined as an application of web 2.0
                technologies which is basically used for knowledge sharing. It
                is a community driven web service such as blogs, wikis etc.

                Enterprise 2.0 comes from the two groups named as “techies” and
                “newbies”. Both of these groups started using these techniques
                and realize several benefits of it. Techies identified that they

                2.0 to share knowledge. One of the major barriers faced by them
                is the lack of support from the organization. They require
                proper support and guidance at the time of using any new tool.
                In is the major factor which highly affects the participation of
                employees in an organization. On the hand, some users stated
                that they can get huge number of information on different blogs
                and wiki’s. Somewhere they might get confused of what type of
                information is successful for them (Cook, 2008). Different
                organizations share different information on the social
                networking sites due to which information might get overload. In
                this way, it can be define that employees might get confused and
                revolve around finding most appropriate information. Workers are
                having fear of trust and security while using different social
                networking sites. It is also defines as a major issue that they
                do not easily trust such sites. Due to this trust, most of the
                customers are not ready to share any type of information with
                customers. Moreover, it can be determine that companies using
                this tool are not able to develop a higher level of trust on the
                customers due to lack of security issues. Moreover, it can be
                define that appropriate plan need to be developed by company so
