                utmost important and those are completely based on persons and
                not on the technological updates. Wanberg, et al. (2016) has

                the decisions with respect to the problems. With this skills and
                its betterment has to lead the industry to take important
                changes which have to lead to growth in the number. The change
                in the macroeconomic factors has also lead to a lot of changes
                in the industry. The changes in the legislation such as the
                former federal and the labour government in order to guard the
                coastal area involved in the shipping sector. The legislation is
                changed to maritime.
