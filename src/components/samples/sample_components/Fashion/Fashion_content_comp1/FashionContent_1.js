                With rise of globalisation, organisations get opportunity to
                expand their business in international market, more easily. It
                helps in enhancing customer base and developing high economy to
                run business successfully (Phau, Teah and Chuah, 2015). In
                context with companies dealing in fashion industry, expanding
                business at global level, not only provide benefits but also
                give various challenges. As when so many companies run their
                business on same marketplace, then it rises competition among
                them. In addition to this, getting a range of products on
                different-different price rates also impact on behaviour of
                customers. As they demand more from trendy and fashionable
                clothes that suits their personality from&nbsp;organisations.
                Therefore, to complete desires of targeted customers and exceed
                level of satisfaction, create various difficulties for such
                companies. In context with M&amp;S, it is considered as one of
                the best fashion retailer industries in UK. It has opened more
                than 300 stores in 40 overseas locations to enhance its customer
                base. But with rise of globalisation, it faces various issues
                related to social attitude in fashion industry.

                In order to conduct a research in systematic manner, it is
                essential for researchers to formulate appropriate aims and
                objectives. This would help in monitoring the entire activities
                related to survey for obtaining higher outcomes (Kim and Ko,
                2012). Therefore, in context with present research, aims and

            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                The recent entry of various fashion brands in international
                marketplace, decreases sales of existing organisation and create
                numerous challenges as well. It includes changing demand of
                customers, bargaining power of both suppliers and consumers,
                threats of entry of new competitor and more. All these
                challenges impact on profitability and sales performance of
                organisations dealing in fashion industry (Kamal, Chu and
                Pedram, 2013). The main purpose of conducting this research is
                to identify how international brands influences social attitudes
                in fashion industry. It entails changing behaviour of customers
                due to emergence of international organisation. In addition to
                this, it also describes strategies that M&amp;S can use to deal
                with such challenges.

            <p>
              <span>
                As per article given by Kaisa Vehmas and et. al. (2019), it has
                identified that in fashion-industries, competition has become
                more intense. It is mainly increase due to fast-developing and
                affordable fashion which leads to change behaviour of customers
                also. People seek to get more trendy clothes and garments on
                reasonable rates to satisfy their needs. In addition to this,
                fast-fashion has become more popular as well as socially
                conscious movement, which shifts mindset of people from quantity
                to quality (Consumer attitude and communication in circular
                fashion, 2019). With emergence of organisations dealing in
                fashion industry, people concerns more on high-quality and
                fashionable trends of marketplace. In addition to this, as a
                result of fast fashion trend, customers are also discarding to
                higher volumes of textile waste. This would lead to reduce use
                of water, chemicals and energy in production of high quality of
                garments. Therefore, usage of wear and tear, non-removable
                stains turn textiles non-reusable. This type of products can be
                recycled or used as raw material.

                consumers
              </span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                According to views and perception of Bertoli (2013), it has
                evaluated that changing behaviour of customers impact
                sustainability of organisations, in international market. As
                emergence of fashion industries at same marketplace impact
                hugely on perception and preference of customers. Therefore, it
                create various challenges for companies dealing in fashion
                industries. In context with M&amp;S, getting a range of
                fashionable clothes on desired rates, move its targeted
                customers towards other organisations(Grayson and Hodges, 2017).
                So, this would lead to reduce customer base, decrease sales
                performance and more, which directly impacts on profitability
                and sustainability on business. It also arise issues related to
                attract new customers towards business as they want more trendy
                and fashionable clothes.

                fashion industry

            </h3>
            <p>
              <span>
                As per different perception and view points of Kim and et. al.
                (2012), it has analysed that to deal with challenges and
                changing behaviour of customers, M&amp;S need to adopt effective
                strategies. It includes developing price strategies i.e. offer
                products on competitive price rates, promoting business through
                effective communication technologies etc. Therefore, to enhance
                sales performance, M&amp;S should concern on adding more values
                in existing products. In addition to this, by using social media
                technology, it can develop effective relationship with national
                and international customers. This would help in getting their
                retention for longer period of time as well.
