                              solving problems and finding solutions as well.
                              This skill also assist people to give respect to
                              each other and bullying also so that stronger
                              relationship can be build.

                              considered as one of my major weaknesses which I
                              need to be improved.

                                during interview process. Negotiation is a
                                process through which individuals settle out
                                their differences. Through this a compromise is
                                done or an conclusion is being found out while
                                neglecting conflicts or arguments. In case if
                                one party does not agree to another than they
                                find out ways to come to an outcome to which
                                both party agrees. The process of negotiation
                                includes various stages which are preparation,
                                discussion, clarification of goals, negotiate
                                towards a win win outcome, agreement and
                                implementation of a course of action.
