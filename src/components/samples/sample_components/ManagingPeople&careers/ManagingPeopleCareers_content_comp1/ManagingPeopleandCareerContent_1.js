                          I am writing to express my interest for the position
                          of Graduate Research Executive at Ipsos MORI which I
                          observed in the advertisement posted upon the website
                          of company as on 5 December, 2018. I possess high
                          confidence in my abilities and skills that are
                          required for the post at Ipsos MORI. To become
                          renowned and successful in the field of research, a
                          person needs to possess analytical skills so as to
                          notice the minute details in relation to the subject
                          of research. I believe that I have these abilities so
                          as to accomplish the tasks that will be required to be
                          delivered by me. I have an innovative approach towards
                          performing the daily tasks and observe the slightest
                          of change in my surroundings which will help me in the
                          time of carrying out research on any subject. This
                          would assist me in conducting an in-depth study of the
                          topic concerned so as to show high level of
                          concentration and firm belief in myself to do any task
                          assigned to me. Also, being a person who possess an
                          excellent history of healthy relationships with peers,
                          seniors, executives and teachers and profit driven
                          approach towards tasks, I firmly believe that I am fit
                          for the position of Graduate Research Executive.

                          I possess great interest in carrying out research and
                          analysis of any subject matter. I enjoy doing the
                          interpretation of data and conducting the conversion
                          of information into numerical figures. Along with
                          this, I possess keen interest in using statistical
                          tables and techniques like line diagram, pie charts,
                          bar graph, frequency polygon, histogram etc. During my
                          time in ABC College also, I was highly inclined
                          towards doing the projects involving marketing and
                          research. In my tenure there, I took various efforts
                          to carry out studies that involved making use of my
                          observatory and analytical skills. Also, I undertook a
                          6 months internship with National Skills Society,
                          London. I performed various tasks during that tenure.
                          The major task that I carried out during my internship
                          was to create attractive and innovative web pages and
                          doing a research along with making presentation on
                          success gained by artisans of United Kingdom. Herein,
                          I used my technological knowledge and performed the
                          task with the assistance of my research skills. When I
                          delivered the presentation after 2 weeks of study
                          about the topic, I was praised by officials for my
                          in-depth research and demonstration of information. I
                          possess high interest in research vacancy at Ipsos
                          MORI and strongly believe that my educational as well
                          as internship background along with my skills makes me
                          ideal for the job position of Graduate Research
                          Executive at company.

                          my peers, senior and teaching staff. When I read about
                          the research vacancy at Ipsos MORI, I realised that my
                          abilities match the &nbsp;profile mentioned in
                          advertisement of company and that it is an opportunity
                          for me to explore my field of interest. I have hereby

                  While I was in college, there was a function organised for
                  World Youth Skills Day in auditorium. For that day, a
                  competition was also arranged by college faculties. Herein,
                  students were supposed to work in a team of 10 people and
                  prepare a power point presentation of 10 minutes. This
                  presentation was to be based upon the success achieved by any
                  multi-national corporation of our choice over a span of last 8
                  years. The demonstration was to be done in front of the whole
                  college during the function. We decided to complete all the
                  tasks and necessary preparation related to presentation in 4
                  meetings. During our first meeting, we collected and discussed
                  all the pre requisites for the PPT. Also, the allotment of
                  individual tasks for every person was done then. I was
                  assigned two tasks, one was to make all arrangements for
                  meeting and second was to prepare the Presentation finally.
                  Both of them were difficult tasks without which the work given
                  to us could not be completed. Also, the complexity in relation
                  to arranging for meetings was that every person had a
                  different time table which made it tougher for me to arrive at
                  a time when all 10 of us were free. By having individual
                  conversations with all of them, I was able to arrange meetings
                  post which the opinions and views in relation to subject
                  matter were shared and compiled. When all necessary data and
                  numerical figures were successfully organised, I finally
                  created a Power Point Presentation. When this PPT was
                  presented in front of whole college, the faculties praised for
                  us in-depth knowledge and study of organisation and its
                  historical performance.

                  When I was undertaking an internship at National Skills
                  Society for a time span of 6 months, I was once given a task
                  to collect and combine the results of a survey conducted of
                  500 persons who gave their opinion about “impact of
                  globalisation on marketing function of company”. This data was
                  to be presented by me to a group of individuals from non
                  technical background. I was given a week to execute this task.
                  I knew that if the data was presented in technical
                  terminology, it would not be easily perceived by group. Thus,
                  I planned to conduct a deep study about the survey and note
                  the results in an organised manner. This helped me in
                  converting the technical data into feasible language that
                  could be easily interpreted by any person. Further, I decided
                  to make a Power Point Presentation so as to present data
                  organised by me in a structured manner for the group of
                  working individuals. To successfully implement this, I made
                  use of pie-charts, bar graphs and histograms so that data
                  could be easily analysed by them without much knowledge about
                  subject matter. On the final day of the presentation, the
                  non-technical working group was impressed by me. They
                  congratulated me for implementing the difficult task easily
                  and wished me luck for my future avenues.

                  During my college tenure, I was given a project to be made
                  upon a multi-national company of UK and its working patterns.
                  Also, I was given the task to do some improvements in a
                  project that I was given in last semester. It was difficult
                  for me to do the prioritization of tasks as I had my semester
                  exams in next week so I had to study for that also. Yet all
                  these 3 tasks were urgent and needed to be done on a prior
                  basis. Thus, I decided to ascertain time required for all the
                  three tasks and then decide their superiority while doing
                  things. After calculating individual time for all, I decided
                  that I will first complete the old project in which I just had
                  to make certain modifications so as to meet requirements of
                  college faculties. Next on order list decided by me was the
                  new project assigned to me recently and lastly, I decided to
                  study for my exams. In this way, by prioritising all the
                  projects, I successfully managed to complete every task within
                  set time frame.

                  During my tenure at BCD college, as a part of&nbsp;my college
                  assignment, I was made to work with 4 students in a team and
                  demonstrate “the effect of non governmental organisations on
                  welfare of society”. When the the topic was given to us, my
                  team mates thought that presenting the information on subject
                  matter in form of written report would yield positive results.
                  They were of this view as in past, one of the teams in
                  previous batch also applied the same approach and attained
                  maximum marks in class. I had a contrasting thought as I
                  considered about presenting the data in visual form by way of
                  bars, charts and other statistical tools and techniques. I
                  planned to make a 1 minute demo of how I wanted the task to be
                  executed. When I presented my views in front of group by way
                  of a PPT, they were convinced with my approach and I was
                  finally successful in persuading them to perform the task
                  according to my view and belief.
