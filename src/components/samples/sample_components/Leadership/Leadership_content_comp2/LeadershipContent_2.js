                This report is based on the Effects of Leadership Style on
                Employee Motivation.&nbsp;Leadership&nbsp;style is defined as an
                approach that aids to provide dire ction, implementing plans and
                motivates employees in order to get the results effectively and
                efficiently (McColl-Kennedy and Anderson, 2002). For any
                organization leaders play a crucial role as they create the
                vision of success. Hence, there are number of requirements for
                an enterprise like initiatives, flexibility and creative problem
                solving. Therefore, leader can be termed out as person who
                influences his subordinates towards achievement of
                organizational goal. Thus, leadership styles generally work as
                to bring improved and effective leadership style. This is the
                process that effective leader sets a clear direction,
                communicating the goals and ensures the all subordinates that
                has own objectives to have clear strategic plan. The purpose of
                the study is to access the effects of leadership style on
                employee motivation and to determine the concept about
                leadership style on business performance. For this research, to
                make the basis of the structure I’ve used deductive research
                approach. Firstly, In this research there is Literature review
                which explains the existing literature written by authors on the
                same topic which helps us find the aim, objectives and
                hypothesis of the research, then there is justification and
                contextualization which explains why this research is important,
                why is it important to find what we are trying to find, How will
                it build on the existing body of evidence and if it is timely.
                Then there is methodology which gives the brief information
                about the methods, philosophies, approaches, instruments and
                design used in this research, then methodology continues with
                the sample size, ethical consideration and limitation. Then the
                research contains Data analysis which exists of univariate
                analysis and after that findings are discussed and lined to draw
                conclusion. In the end, there is bibliography. This research
                will help us to explore the effects of leadership style on
                employee motivation in order to achieve the organizational goal
                and to investigate the relationship between the leaders and
                employees and their commitment to bring long term productivity.
                My research is based on the business activities of Aaron
                Enterprise, New Delhi, India. It is an entity that manufactures
                all kinds of kitchen products. This is a company that deals in

                consists of a questionnaire for the employees working in Aaron
                Enterprise in order to find out the leadership style used in the
                enterprise and if the leadership style motivates the employee in

                the view of Philip Sadler, (2003) leadership is a powerful
                concept capable of motivating people towards the same
                organizational goal in order to bring effectiveness in the
                organization. Bhatti, et.al., (2012)stated that leadership is
                process that is derived as team of roles and responsibilities
                that aids to organisation and people working in it by serving
                the enterprise to grow business activities effectively and
                efficiently. Effective leadership is the term that has ability
                to create and sustaining organisation and its employees in order
                to promote better working environment. As per the view of
                Para-González and et.al., (2018) stated that great leaders are
                able to perform their work with practical application of skills
                and to develop better networking in terms to both internally and
                externally. Leaders must have proper skills as knowledge,
                ability, willingness and commitment towards the organisation.
                Therefore, encourage and motivation are both crucial factors
                that leads to conduct each work in better and effective manner.

                McColl-Kennedy and Anderson, (2002) stated leadership is the
                process that is inclusive of things as encouraging innovation,
                team work, creativity and this all leads to increased
                performance of employees. Hence, leadership is the one of the
                crucial areas of management that support to perform each
                activity in cordial and efficient mode. According to the view of
                Sethibe, (2018)stated that leadership is the ability of firm
                management that set and achieve challenging goals and inspire
                other to take better and effective decision. Bhatti, et.al.,
                (2012)stated that leadership strategy defined as map that align
                investment in process of leadership development with the help of
                strategy, goals and aspiration of the business. Hence, it can be
                stated that leadership is the process that aids to attract the
                individual outside the enterprise so that all things can be done
                effectively and efficiently towards the same organizational
                goal. However, Bhatti, et.al., (2012)stated that greater leader
                must have the responsibility to maintain a balance between short
                term performance and it works as to build better future. It is
                very effective term that aids to develop the integrity among the
                organisation and it is effective term that aids to enhance
                competition of organisation. Thus, strategic investments and
                long-term challenges ensures success so that better leader can
                conduct the working enterprise effectively and efficiently.
                According to the view of Bhatti, et.al., (2012) it can be said
                that effective leaders can also be seen as valuable assets to
                the enterprise. They perform their works as to serve as a role
                model and it also aids to inspire subordinates and also
                challenge them to take greater ownership of work. It is one of
                the leadership approaches that aids to achieve greater employee
                engagement in the workplace. Hence, Sethibe, (2018) stated that
                role model is also key motivator that influences people in order
                to reach their goals. Therefore, leader to the enterprise must
                perform their role as to specific, measurable attainable,
                realistic and time constrained. Therefore, leaders must work as
                to encourage team work and by undertaking win relationship can
                be built. Hence, leadership is the process in which ideas can be
                shared among the individual in freely and open manner.
                Therefore, better leadership is one of an effective term as it
                helps to have improvement in morale and make workers more
                committed towards the enterprise and aids to have enhancement in

                the degree of effectiveness among the leaders must be measured
                by the effect of leaders on the behaviour of employees. Buil,

                managers incorporate the own personal style and also administer
                the brand of leadership. With the help of using the effective
                leadership style, it can be possible to motivate the employees
                to conduct their work practices in better and efficient manner.
                Therefore, leadership maximise efficiency of employees and it
                leads to achieve enterprise goals.

                Yes, it will be on timely. Leadership style put their major
                consideration over to enhance motivation of employees for
                conducting better working practices. Employees to the enterprise
                must provide training facilities so that they can improve their
                working capabilities. Henceforth, training aids to streamline
                the operations of the entity. Thus, leader to entity must
                appoint specialise authority that can direct training within the
                periodical manner. By use of leadership practices the all
                functions can be conducted in effective and efficient mode.
                Thus, leader to entity must identify employees who need
                training. Hence, the employees to the enterprise get feel
                motivated with help of having enhancement in knowledge and
                skills. Leader is the person who encourage employees and get the
                things done effectively.

                It is a technique for collecting data, it can involve specific
                research tool or a variety of techniques (O’Regan, 2018).
                Research Onion Process has been used for the above research as
                it explains every part involved in the research process. Hence,
                there are different aspects of methodologies such as research
                philosophy, research approach, research time frame and research
                strategy. This section contains the detailed information about
                data collection process, data analysis, sampling technique,
                ethical consideration:

                It means a belief with the help of which phenomenon should be
                considered and data can be gathered and analysed. (O’Regan,
                2018). To gain the knowledge of the data collected depending on
                the sample size there are different approaches like positivism,
                interpretivism and realism. Positivism philosophy is defined as
                a term which is based on experiments and statistic and define
                the specific (Laudan, L., 1996). For my report, I have adopted
                positivism philosophy.

                combination of data collected will help the research to cross
                check the data so that research questions can be addressed
                effectively. Whereas the interpretivism is used for qualitative
                methods and the realism is used for both

              <span>
                Research approach is classified into mainly three categories as
                deduction, induction and abduction. Induction approach is an
                approach of using observations to develop general principles
                about a subject (O’Regan, 2018). Deduction approach is a theory
                testing process of proving the validity of hypothesis (Hyde,
                K.F., 2000). In this research, I have adopted Deduction
                approach.

                Justification of choosing: In order to undertake the present
                research, researcher has used deductive approach in terms to
                conduct theory testing. In this, data can be evaluated on the
                basis of data collection process and validity hypothesis is
                generated and design the research design to test the hypothesis.

                    Data collection process is a process of collecting
                    information on differed variables of interest in an
                    established systematic mode (Hox, et.al., 2005). It enables
                    to answer relevant question and also supports to evaluate
                    outcomes.

                    There are two types of data collection methods are
                    classified as primary and secondary method. Under primary
                    method, data is being collected directly from respondents.
                    This method of research can be conducted with help of
                    conducting surveys, telephonic conservation, interviews etc.
                    In Secondary method number of research paper are being used
                    as journal articles, company website, government site
                    (Kumar, R. 2011). In present research, we will use primary
                    method as it is more reliable, and the research will be
                    based on what we need to find. Therefore, the surveys from
                    the employees of the enterprise is considered in terms to
                    getting the idea of recommended strategies for overcoming
                    the things.

                    There are two types of research design which is classified
                    as quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative research is
                    well structured and more specific towards the topic, in this
                    type of research there is a distinction between the research
                    design and methods. Whereas, Qualitative research is less
                    specific and do not has structural depth and in this type of
                    research there is an overlap between the research design and
                    methods (Kumar, R. 2011).

                    In this research, I’ve used quantitative method as it has
                    been tested for its validity and reliability, and it is
                    based on more numerical data and less observations, so it is
                    easy to analysis whereas qualitative data is based on more
                    observations and less numeric data and is hard to analyse.
                    The instrument I am using to collect the data is
                    questionnaire.

                        <strong>Questionnaire:</strong>&nbsp;Questionnaire is
                        the method of collecting data in which every respondent
                        is asked to answer same set of question in a
                        predetermined order (O’Regan, 2018). The questionnaire
                        used in this research consists of questions with scale
                        scores in which one end of a scale strongly agrees and
                        the other end of the scale strongly disagrees, and the
                        questionnaire starts with the basic question whether the
                        employees get support from their superior and goes on in
                        order to find the effects of Leadership style on
                        employee motivation. For the present research study, I
                        am conducting a survey which consists of a questionnaire
                        for the employees working in Aaron enterprises. They
                        will be the questionnaire participants which will help
                        me analyse the leadership style used in their
                        organization and if it effects the employee’s
                        motivation. Questionnaire has been used in this research
                        as it allows me to get more respondents in less time and
                        is easy to analyse with the purpose of gathering
                        information related to the topic and in this participant
                        have the right to stay anonymous. Whereas, interviews
                        are time consuming and difficult to analyse.

                        of central tendency and measure of dispersion. (O’Regan,
                        2018). I’ve used this type of analysis method as is the
                        simplest method to analyse the data and it has only one
                        variable. This method of analysis doesn’t deal with

                    In order to analyze the leadership style used in the
                    enterprise and the relationship between the employees and
                    their superiors working in Aaron Enterprise. The first
                    question was asked to know whether they get enough support
                    from the superior in order to finish the work effectively
                    and efficiently. The results based on the questionnaire
                    showed that total number of participants were 15 and out of
                    that 4 (27%) strongly agreed, 5 (33%) of them agreed, 4
                    (27%) were neutral and 2 (13%) out of that disagreed. Hnece,
                    it can be stated that most of the participants agreed that
                    they are satisfied with provided support from their
                    superiors in order to work effectively and efficiently.

                    Second question was asked from the employees working in
                    Aaron enterprise was that if the management is really
                    interested in motivating the employees which helped us to
                    find that if the employees are happy and motivated. The
                    results based on the questionnaire showed that total number
                    of participants were 15 and out of that 3 (20%) employees
                    strongly agrees, 7 (47%) agrees, 3 (20%) are neutral and 2
                    (13%) of them disagreed. Therefore, it can be stated that
                    most of the employees working in the enterprise are
                    motivated in order to work towards the same organizational
                    goal effectively and efficiently.

                    Third question asked from the employees working in Aaron
                    enterprise was that how far they are satisfied with the
                    incentives provided by the enterprise which helped us to
                    find out that the employees if they are satisfied with the
                    incentives provided by the enterprise as the incentives,
                    rewards and compensation or other kind of monetary benefits
                    attracts employee to perform their role effectively. The
                    results based on the questionnaire showed that the total
                    number of participants were 15 and out of that 2 (13%)
                    employees strongly agreed, 6 (40%) of them agreed, 5 (33%)
                    were neutral, 1 (7%) disagreed and 1 (7%) strongly
                    disagreed. Therefore, it can be stated that the enterprise
                    provides enough incentives in order to keep the employees
                    satisfied but not happy as some of the employees agreed with
                    the question but there are a lot of percentage of employees
                    who are neutral which states that enterprise should provide
                    more incentives to keep the employees happy and motivated in
                    order to achieve organizational goal.

                    Sixth question asked from the employees working in Aaron
                    enterprise was that if they believe that there is a
                    relationship between leadership style and employee
                    commitment towards the same organizational goal. The results
                    based on the questionnaire showed that the total number of
                    participants were 15 and out of that 2 (13%) employees
                    strongly agreed, 6 (40%) of them agreed, 5 (33%) were
                    neutral, 1 (7%) disagreed and 1 (7%) strongly disagreed.
                    Therefore, it can be stated that there could be a relation
                    between leadership style and employee commitment towards
                    same organizational goal.

                    In order to draw meaningful inferences, firstly, the data
                    has been collected by way of Questionnaires with a sample of
                    15 employees contributing their perception towards the
                    concepts of Leadership Style, Motivation and Commitment.
                    After the data was collected from such employees of Aaron
                    Enterprises, a Univariate Descriptive Analysis has been
                    performed. As per this data analysis method, each question
                    or variable has been taken into account so as to gain
                    valuable insights through isolation of each element. It is
                    important to note that Univariate does not depict a
                    cause-and-effect relationship rather describes each
                    component in a detailed manner.

                    It is also worthy to note that all the employees (N=15)
                    readily provided their views for each and every question in
                    a prompt manner. The results achieve in Section 6 of this
                    research report have been enumerated as under:

                      <span>
                        3% of the total respondents agreed that their superiors
                        supported them continuously and they were satisfied with
                        it. However, it 26.7% were of the 15 employees were
                        neutral and agreed strongly with the given statement.
                        This indicates that out of all the respondents
                        leadership style exercised by the management was either
                        encouraged or did not impact much of the audience as
                        they opted to remain neutral regarding it.

                        In any organisation including Aaron, it is the
                        responsibility of the management to ensure that all the
                        employees are happy and motivated to take initiatives at
                        workplace. Majority (47%) of respondents indicated
                        agreeableness to this element while only 13.3%
                        disagreed. Thus, showing that Aaron’s authorities
                        strived to make sure that their staff’s morale is high
                        at all times.

                        Another important criteria to consider while analysing
                        the effect of Leadership Styles on Employee motivation
                        is Incentives. Again, such rewards help in boosting
                        individual morale and maintains productivity in the
                        workplace. 40% of respondents gave a positive feedback
                        by agreeing to this element. Whereas 12.5% of the them
                        disagreed to the given statement. This indicates that
                        the management has induced reward system in order
                        encourage a positive and healthily competitive
                        environment at workplace.

                        73% of total employees agree with the fact that
                        leadership style does act as a driving force in
                        enhancing corporate performance. Even though univariate
                        does not show cause-and-effect relationship, the
                        statement was able to connect the two. Thus, showing
                        that if the employees were not satisfied with leadership
                        style, they would directly feel demotivated and reduce
                        overall productivity which is again a critical factor in
                        measuring corporate performance.

                        their leadership, 60% of them gave a positive feedback.
                        Thus, providing a valuable insight on the perception of
                        effective leaders underpinning delegation of

                        established through the sixth statement of the

                        benefits do play an important role in enhancing employee
                        as well as organisational performance. 47% of them also
                        considered Bonus as the most preferred incentives option
                        followed by Promotion. On the other hand, 40% of the
                        employees remained neutral when asked whether or not
                        they were satisfied with leadership measures adopted by

                    leadership styles differ among organisations on the basis of
                    nature, size and complexity of the business. Hence, it is
                    important for the leader to maintain balance between
                    performance as well as goals in an effective manner. It is
                    also evident from the univariate analysis conducted on the
                    basis of data collected through Questionnaire that
                    leadership aids in the maximisation of efficiency or
                    productivity among employees as well as enables their
                    retention in a sustainable manner. For this purpose, it was
                    important to assess the employees of Aaron Enterprises on
                    the basis of motivation and commitment. Based on the
                    results, it can be clearly concluded that both these

                    control procedures which would enable them to work
                    effectively and efficiently in all such industrial sectors.
                    Through the findings achieved by conducting this
                    investigation, it can be rightfully asserted that employee
                    engagement is acquired by an organisation such as Aaron
                    through exercising coherent leadership styles. Mainly due to
                    the reason that leadership styles share a significant and
                    directly impactful relationship with variables such as
                    Motivation as well as Commitment that are critical for
                    corporate performance and sustainable success in the long
                    run for companies like Aaron.
