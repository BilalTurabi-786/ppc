            <p>2. Strategy to Implement the Vision</p>
            <p>2.1 Strategic goals and objectives to be achieved to implement the vision Strategic goals and objectives can be achieved with the help of performance indicators as well as critical success factors. A key performance indicator or performance indicator is a kind of measurement of performance. A company may use KPIs to assess a particular activity’s success in which it is involved. Sometimes success is described in terms of making growth toward goals that are strategic, but often it is simply the periodic, repeated achievement of some operational goal level. Accordingly, decide on the right KPIs relies upon a good comprehending of what is significant to the company. What is significant often depends on section measuring the performance, for e.g. the KPI’s helpful to finance will be too different from that of KPIs assigned to sales. Since there is a requirement to comprehend well what is significant to a company, various methods to review the present business state, and its major activities, are concerned with the performance indicators selection (Andrew, 2012). These reviewing often leads to determination of prospective improvements, so indicators of performance are regularly associated with improvement of performance initiatives. A quite common way to select KPIs is to apply a framework of management such as the balanced scorecard. Indicators marked and identifiable as likely candidates for KPIs can be sum up into the following sub-categories (Dihal and et.al., 2013)</p>
            <p>Quantitative indicators , Qualitative indicators, Leading indicators, Lagging indicators, Input indicators, Process indicators, Output indicators, Practical indicators, Directional indicators, Actionable indicators, Financial indicators. A company may apply all the above indicators which are commonly used to achieve strategic goals and objectives of the business. Organizational Principles:</p>

            <p>In 2015, recoverable amount is higher than carrying figure so there is no journal entry has been made.</p>
            <strong>C. Explaining the reasons for impairment</strong>
            <p>In 2014, carrying amount is $200000, whereas recoverable amount implies for $110000. Hence, carrying amount is higher than recoverable cost which shows the loss of $90000. Carrying cost – recoverable amount $200000 – $110000 = $90000</p>

            <h3>QUESTION 3</h3>
            <strong>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards</strong>
            <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated below:</p>

                <li>
                <p><span>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p><span>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow for the preparation of financial statements.</span></p>
