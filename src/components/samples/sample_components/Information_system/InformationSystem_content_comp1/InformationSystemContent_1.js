                The literature review is about creating an innovative business
                culture. Today, number of small organizations is unable to make
                profits and grow their business. It happens due to lack of
                organizational management system. Therefore, these businesses
                needs an innovative business culture where the culture will
                include implementation of innovative marketing techniques,
                tools, strategies and theories. The management department needs
                to be strong. The managers needs to focus on implementing
                management theories for the betterment of the company.

                The theories of management are implemented for increasing the
                service quality and productivity of a particular organization.
                Theories such as contingency theory, chaos theory, system theory
                as well as theory y and theory x. Most of the managers do not
                use a single theory during the implementation of some theories
                and strategies on the workplace. Out of these theories, only
                theory x and theory y are implemented to increase the
                productivity at workplace. The theories are described
                below&nbsp;<strong>System Theory</strong>: The managers who
                apply this theory identifies how different systems affect a
                worker and how an employee affects the systems around them.
                Moreover, a system consists of a variety of parts that work and
                operates together for accomplishing the goals of the
                organization. The particular theory is a broad perspective that
                allows managers to investigate events and patterns of the
                company. As a result, it helps the managers to synchronize
                programs that would work as a collective whole for the overall
                mission and goal of the company rather for secluded departments.
                According to Cunningham (2013), system theories are a useful
                application in determining the knowledge, skill and competence
                of employees. Thus, system theories are helpful in knowledge
                management. Apart from it, this theory helps in creating the
                value in business. When discussing the quality issues, it is
                important to focus the link between system thinking and TQM.
                System theories are also useful for maintaining the relationship
                within and outside the organization. It helps to establish
                communication channels, organize the flow of information and
                rationalize the development of a firm aligned with all the
                external relationship. In the real world, it is believed that
                system theories and perspectives can contribute to marketing,
                service and management of an organization (“Theory first or
                theory last?”, 2008).&nbsp;<strong>Contingency Theory</strong>:
                Tsumoto (2009) stated that contingency theory assets that
                managers of an organization make decisions concerning about the
                situation at hand rather than a unique method. Besides that, a
                manager takes proper action regarding the aspects of most
                important to the present circumstances. Also, the manager of a
                company wants to utilize a leadership approach that consists of
                participation of workers. Contingency theory has been applied in
                management accounting research for addressing three types of
                questions. The first question is about the fit between the
                structure and control of an organization (Madanipour, 2010). The
                second issue is concerned about the impact of such fits on the
                performance. The third is about the investigation of multiple
                contingencies as well as their impact on the design of the
                organization. The particular theories were developed from the
                sociological functionalist theories of organization structure
                like the structural approaches to the organizational studies.
                Contingency theory is concerned with the issues of control.
                Here, the issue of monitoring is examined along three main
                traditions such as the psychological, sociological and
                administrative perspectives. Now, Sociological perspectives are
                concerned with the entire organization as well as the large
                groups within it (Madanipour, 2010). On the other hand,
                organizational aspects deal with the departments and individuals
                of a company. The psychological perspectives accentuate standard
                goal and setting along with rewards, feedbacks and interpersonal
                influence within an organization.&nbsp;
                <strong>Theory Y and Theory X</strong>: According to this
                particular theory, an individual chooses to implement is
                strongly prejudiced by beliefs about the attitudes of the
                worker. Moreover, the managers who believe that the employees
                naturally lack ambition and need bonuses and incentives for
                increasing the productivity of the workflow lean towards this
                particular theory. According to theory Y, the employees are
                apparently driven and take responsibility. According to
                McGregor, there are two sorts of manager: Theory Y and Theory X.
                On one hand, theory X managers expect that authorities are
                drowsy, will avoid commitment, and need to just get by. Theory X
                suppositions assume that workers must be controlled and
                undermined with the train. According to HITT (2011), the
                managers of theory X implements an authoritarian style of
                leadership.&nbsp; Then again, McGregor saw Theory Y
                administrators as those that hold doubts that authorities
                consider the organization, will search for commitment, and
                exercise self-control. Bobic and Davis found that most of the
                masses can be creative and imaginative. The specific finding
                reinforces the dispute that Theory Y doubts contribute firmly
                toward more participative fundamental administration, in the end
                benefitting the organization (Freeman, 2000).&nbsp;
                <strong>Chaos Theory</strong>: Chaos theory is constant, and it
                identifies that change is unavoidable and is rarely measured.
                When an organization grows, the possibility and complexity for
                susceptible events increase. Moreover, the companies increase
                energy for maintaining the new level of complexity. More
                structure is needed for stability when the particular
                organization spends more energy. However, the system continues
                to change and evolve (Freeman, 2000). From the financial aspect,
                the analyses of the chaos theory can be secluded into two sorts.
                One is a correct fundamental model and the second approach is
                chaos theory tangibility in showing and deciding the financial
                direct. The isolated information was separated into the going
                with orders: Non-linearity, strange attractors, butterfly
                effect, bifurcation and self-organization. There were challenges
                related to the chaos theory. For example, Sellnow et al.
                denounced the usage of chaos theory all things considered since
                it is unreasonably wide, in this way they suggested using
                thoughts got from chaos theory and this proposition is in like
                manner used to show the results (Ye, 2009). In company with this
                audit, it was promising to study chaos theory thoughts that
                delineate bona fide issues and their congruity to appraise
                financial crisis.

              <span>The key issues in information services management</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span>
                The information and service management gives an individual
                in-depth expertise regarding the management and development of
                information-based services. Investigating key issues in
                information management need the role of information
                professionals in adapting to the present information
                environment. The issues vary from complex team to service-level
                problem. According to Ojasalo (2002), the current issues are
                sweeping across the experts in the world comprising the
                information profession. When an organization deals with service
                based on information management, they face with such grave
                issues. Moreover, some emerging issues have risen in recent
                times ranging from knowledge and information society to
                knowledge and information management to professional attitudes,
                skills and competencies (Zawacki, 2002). However, the employees
                and the organizations always resist change whether beneficial or
                not. The companies also resist change even if it leads to an
                efficient and better system. Tapping into these issues and
                having a fresh look into it for information professionals is
                equally essential for information service management. A review
                of the contemporary literature shows that since time devotion
                distinctive attempts have been made to describe these immovably
                related thoughts. In this manner, it is basic to fathom the
                definition, difference and relationship among information,
                wisdom, knowledge and data before information management or IM
                and knowledge management or KM. In any case, there is no
                agreement inside the literature on the agreed definitions
                (Zawacki, 2002). Moreover, different makers have noted immovably
                that the literature on information management and knowledge
                management is stacked with refinements among data, information,
                knowledge and wisdom. Hence, Faucher et al. watch that the
                etymological foundations of these terms uncovered some insight
                into the derivation of their significance. Strikingly, the
                timeliest recorded utilization of each of the conditions happens
                in reverse demand from their all things considered saw the level
                of straight forwardness according to the traditional knowledge
                hierarchy: wisdom is the most settled state, and data the
                freshest, in English. Now, the key issues are discussed
                below:&nbsp;
                <strong>The emergence of knowledge management</strong>: The
                managers of the organization face challenges regarding knowledge
                management. Initially, security is the main issues (Dekleva,
                &amp; Zupančič, 2004). The provision of a right level of safety
                for knowledge management is critical. The managers have to
                shield their sensitive information from most users. Easy and
                accessible information are allowed to be shared with proper
                credentials by the organization to most users. Moreover, during
                knowledge management operations the managers of the organization
                have to motivate the employees regarding work. The manager has
                to motivate because of overcoming the organizational challenges
                concerning culture and its development. It embraces sharing,
                changing, learning and improving which cannot be done with the
                aid of technology (Dekleva, &amp; Zupančič, 2004). The managers
                have to determine how knowledge should be dispensed and
                transferred quickly and more efficiently. It is a huge challenge
                for them. They have to keep in mind about the constant changes
                in organizational structures so that individuals can learn how
                to be smart, agile, responsive and quick. Apart from it, the
                managers of a particular organization have to keep accurate data
                and also have to interpret them. Keeping current information by
                eliminating the old and wrong ones is a constant battle for the
                managers. Additionally, the managers also take care of the
                active users. It is the duty of a manager to identify and reward
                the active users.&nbsp;
                <strong>Information Communication Technology</strong>: Today,
                technology has modernized the way people communicate in their
                professional and personal lives causes potential problems.
                Issues such as spending too much time online can be socially
                detaching, or failure to protect the computer from hackers can
                lead to stealing of personal information. These problems pose a
                serious threat to managers and the entire company. Cyber crime
                is another issue by which the cyber criminals exploit
                communication technology to perpetrate identity theft as well as
                steal financial information. Moreover, hackers do this by
                installing illegal spyware on people’s computer without their
                consent. They sent viruses and worms via emails and as soon as
                the user opened that mail viruses and worms enters in the system
                and causes computers to malfunction. Therefore, managers need to
                protect the information from these hackers by using anti-hacking
                software which helps them not only to protect the information
                but also to clean the system from junk files. Managers are also
                faced with challenges such as privacy. According to Dhillon
                &amp; Moores (2001), the technology raises concerns about data
                privacy and protection. Conversely, sensitive information stored
                on a particular computer can be compromised with the help of
                carelessness and gossip or by people who have a complaint
                against their employers.&nbsp;
                <strong>Globalization of information services</strong>: Several
                major trends are affecting to globalization. It consists of
                scientific, governance, demographic and economic independence.
                Initially, demography is an issue to the managers of the company
                (Boersma, 2012). In developed countries, it has been found that
                the population is increasing in developed countries. Recruitment
                has a limit. The managers have to take interviews, and it is a
                tough job for the managers to find an able one from a group of
                supposing ten people. On the other hand, science and technology
                are another factors which a manager needs to take care of. The
                managers use internet technology and social networking sites for
                the promotion of the company. Some managers do not like social
                networking, but still, they have to do it for the betterment of
                the enterprise. The organizations need to follow the rules and
                regulation of the government of that nation for the
                globalization of business (Boersma, 2012). Moreover, these
                trends are often independent and cannot be separated easily.
                Aside from, the various factors connected with the trends in
                globalization has been shown to affect the population growth
                which is a serious concern for the managers of a particular
                company.

                The organizations need to solve complex team and service level
                by using marketing tools and strategies. Marketing tools and
                marketing strategies are different from each other. A marketing
                tool is used for implementing a marketing strategy. Here,
                marketing strategies and tools are described below:&nbsp;
                <strong>Making a partnership with associates</strong>:
                Partnerships in marketing have some advantages for pushing a
                marketing campaign. Moreover, for the starters when an
                individual collaborates with someone, he or she tend to deliver
                the better content. Based on the research of Cavicchi (2012),
                partnership with associates helps in strengthening the
                relationship between them. Consequently, it would be helpful for
                making profits with less workforce. According to Sidney
                Calloway, making partner starts with a surviving loyalty to
                superiority in both work and art of an individual’s practice.
                Sidney also recommended to make friendships and built a strong
                professional network. Consequently, it will benefit them
                both.&nbsp;<strong>Helping customers to solve a problem</strong>
                : If an organization and its employees help a client who got
                stuck in a problem, then the company will gain trust and loyalty
                from the customer’s side. Afterwards, the organization can
                achieve its objective of satisfying customer and thus achieve
                its other business goals (“Customer-Centric Marketing

                satisfaction is helpful for the promotion of a company. The
                satisfied customer will recommend another customer of a rival
                company to use the product and services of the particular
                organization. Thus, the particular organization can achieve
                competitive advantage.&nbsp;
                <strong>Using big data to target customers</strong>: Today, big
                data is helping the organizations to target their potential
                clients. For example, a pizza chain uses data to send out
                coupons to their customers who are experiencing inclement
                weather or power outages (Kearney, 2014). The implementation of
                big data is a proper marketing strategy to predict the
                purchasing trends. With the help of this information, the
                company can get in touch with the customers before they search
                for the services or products.&nbsp;
                <strong>Implementation of digital media</strong>: According to
                Liu (2015), digital media is a marketing tool that includes SEO
                or search engine optimization, interactive online
                advertisements, mobile marketing, online partnerships like
                sponsorships and affiliate marketing and opt-in email. With the
                help of digital media, the organization can quickly reach to
                their target customers. Moreover, the key component of
                a&nbsp;digital marketing&nbsp;tool is web analytic
                (Fazlollahtabar, &amp; Yousefpoor, 2009). Web analytic provides
                information on an Internet user’s online activities. The
                organizations can hire digital media marketing agencies for
                engaging themselves in digital media marketing. Consequently,
                the particular marketing tool will help companies to solve the
                service-level problem.&nbsp;<strong>Using social media</strong>:
                Like digital media, social media is also a marketing tool, and
                it is a subset of digital media marketing. Though, the objective
                of social media marketing tools helps the managers of the
                organization to develop a collaborative, online relationship
                with the clients rather than to mine secretly for customer data
                (“Using ontology for goal-based query to evaluate social media
                data”, 2016). Some examples of social media marketing tools are
                tweeting, blogging, Orkut, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit
                as well as Pinterest. Social media marketing tools help
                organizations solve complex team issues as well as service-level
                problems. The particular marketing tools help organizations to
                build a strong relationship with the potential customers.&nbsp;
                <strong>Using Promotional items</strong>: Business cards, press
                kits, websites, informational videos and merchandise all falls
                into the category of promotional items. These promotional items
                are marketing tools, and some of these elements consist of large
                amounts of detailed information as well as highly attributes of
                the service or products (“Using ontology for goal-based query to
                evaluate social media data”, 2016). Moreover, business cards and
                trade helps a company with an opportunity to market abroad.
