                structure. Proceed with your selection of price and standard for
                the table of prices. We would also like to bring it to your
                notice that pricing for a few of the orders depends on the
                nature of your customized requirements; therefore it won’t be
                possible to provide you with the exact cost of your paper
                immediately. For instance, to fulfil editing, modification,
                proofreading or any ad hoc requirement, we have to discuss the
                pricing with our writers. Next step is to fill in the
                requirements section and proceed to the payment page. The order
                process completes when you select a method to pay for our
                services and make the payment. Once the payment is made, we will
                start working on your project.
