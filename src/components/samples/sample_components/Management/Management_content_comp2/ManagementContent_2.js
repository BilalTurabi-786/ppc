                                Bench-marking is the measurement tool that helps
                                in measuring the policies, programs and products
                                of an organization against set standards. It is
                                the practice of an entity for making comparison
                                between key metrics of operations with other
                                competitor brand. Scientific management theory
                                is the great concept that helps in analysing the
                                economic efficiency, labour productivity of an
                                organization. By this way firms like McDonalds
                                can set benchmark by comparing its performances
                                against the industry performance.

                                  As KFC is the biggest competitor of
                                  McDonalds,cited firm compare its products and
                                  services with the KFC and try to match the
                                  standards. McDonalds focuses more on healthy
                                  food and fast services whereas KFC focuses on
                                  the test and needs of consumers. KFC offers
                                  wide range of chicken food to the users
                                  whereas McDonaldsconcentrates on burgers and
                                  limited food items (El-Wardani &amp; Luyanage,
                                  2015). KFC services are fast but products are
                                  costly, on other hand McDonalds products are
                                  comparative of low price. KFC does not have
                                  home delivery services for the consumers but
                                  McDonaldsoffer this facility to its customers.
                                  So in this respect McDonalds needs to enhance
                                  its standards and it has to provide wide range
                                  of products to the consumers so that they get
                                  attracted towards the brand.

                                Benchmarking is considered as a best tool to

                                Therefore, as per proper management different

                                determined. It is helpful for increasing in

                                business operations and

                                gained. In addition, benchmarking tools to
                                measure customer satisfaction level and cost per
                                unit of measure and cycle time of product per
                                unit measure. Thus, total quality management

                                considered through this measurement (Larkin,

                                for improving service qualities of products and
                                organization’s effectiveness is obtained.
                                Significance of benchmarking can be described as

                                    It is very difficult for the management of
