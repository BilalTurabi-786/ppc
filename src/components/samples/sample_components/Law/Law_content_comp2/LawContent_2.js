                transactions in a business. It is also known as “mercantile law”
                or “commercial law”. It operates in two defined areas viz.
                Commercial organizations being governed through laws of company,
                partnership, bankruptcy and agency and the other area is

                protection and resolve the legal disputes by taking references
                from judgements passed. This report exhibits the

                The legal system in UK is divided into three parts viz. English
                Law, Scots Law and Northern Ireland Law. English Law is the
                common legal system of England and Wales, which has its two
                branches; criminal law and civil law. The constitution rule
                decides the legal matter by the application of Acts of
                Parliament, regulations and bye-laws. Further, it is also has
                public and private law. However, UK does not have a single
                written constitution and the existing constitution is unwritten.
                The constitution has defined the rights of the UK citizens. The
                highest authority to pass the order or judgements in the matters
                of civil and criminal is with the Supreme Court. Apart from
                this, European Union law is applicable to the extent of EU
                treaty obligations. The Crown is the unelected head of the state
                and exercise only the ceremonial rights and power relate to
                issues of national security, defence of the monarchy and
                deployment of the armed forces. Crown has the ultimate power and
                authorizes the government to exercise the power on her behalf.
                Further, the Royal Assent is necessary to pass a bill and enact
                as an Act.

                    Case Law:&nbsp;These are the judgements or order passed by
                    the courts, therefore, termed as radical primary sources.
                    Case laws are published in the law report describing the
                    facts, issues and decision and the concept on which the
                    judgement is passed. The English law uses the decisions
                    passed by the courts for making legal decisions in the
                    future. The decisions by the superior courts are of biding
                    nature and it is not compulsory for the judges to take
                    references of the case law decided by the sub-ordinate
                    courts.

                a clear distinction between the company and its management. A
                company can own property in its own right, employ staff and can
                sue or be sued in its own name. The affairs of the company the
                company are managed by the shareholders and directors. The
                liability of shareholders is limited to the nominal price of the
                share that has been paid. The taxation system of a company is
                different from any other form of business and it pays tax on the
                income earned by it. A company can be limited by guarantee or it
                can be even an unlimited company.

                From the above report, it has been concluded that business law
                is must for every company to follow in its dealings. These laws
                are formed by the government by looking into the changes needed
                in the particular area of legal system. Further, there are many
                other laws that are applied to an entity such as employment laws
                and competition laws for better conduct of business activities
                by treating the employees equally and fairly and not involving
                in any unfair trade practices. Further, the companies should
                take references from the judgements passed by the courts. Along
                with this, there should be an appropriate and effective legal
                solution for every legal dispute arising in the conduct of
                business. It is required by the business to know about the
                impact non-compliance of various laws.
