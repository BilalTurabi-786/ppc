                  Child labor is regarded as a serious social problem in which
                  children are engaged in employment practices and work
                  processes (Rugman and Verbeke, 2007). Apparently, children
                  should not be included in employment management; still due to
                  lack of financial resources, families were open for child
                  labour. Most of the children work for their families and also
                  to maintian their livelihood. Thus, in such respect focus has
                  been laid on Nike’s practices regarding child labour. Thus, in
                  this context, the present research study has been emphasizing
                  on Nike which operates business as a athletic footwear
                  organization and which delievers several products and
                  accessories to the consumers. Along with different sports
                  products, Nike is engaged in rendering other acessories as
                  well. The organization is greatly focused on&nbsp;brand
                  management&nbsp;which also ensures to enhance customer
                  satisfaction rate. In this respect, focus has been laid on
                  organizational practices of Nike with regards to child labour
                  in developing countries. Hnece, discussion has also been
                  included regarding labour practices of Nike in South East
                  Asia. Therefore, in this respect reearcher has highlighted all
                  the ethical practices of Nike through using semiotic square
                  (Srivastava, 2011). However, many countries do not prioritize
                  the child development and instead allows its children to get
                  involved in child labor. Many millions of laborers across the
                  world are children where many are working as hidden workers in
                  homes or the underground economy (Srivastava, 2011). The
                  international labor organization prohibits child labor simply
                  because it is a violation of human rights. Child labor is one
                  of the factors contributing to the failure of children to
                  complete education and thus affecting their future negatively.

                  In developing countries, many families are poor, and the issue
                  of family planning is a big challenge. It is easier to find a
                  family with around ten children all under the age of 18years
                  and that both parents are not employed in these
                  countries.Resolving the issue of child labor in such
                  situations is therefore not an easy task (Shah, 1998). This is
                  because the children are in such cases are working to get
                  basic commodities and forcing the companies that employ these
                  children to terminate the employment may lead to the children
                  seeking other employments with lower paid work or even get
                  involved in child prostitution in some cases (Shah, 1998).
                  However, this does not mean that practicing child labor should
                  be encouraged in such areas, but instead, other ways to help
                  the children is encouraged. A good example of child labor
                  issues is Pakistan. In 1996, a life magazine published an
                  article about child labor, and it had had a photo of a
                  12-year-old kind stitching a ball which was a product of Nike.
                  This kid would spend most of the day stitching the pieces
                  together only to be paid 60cents at the end of the day. This
                  article led to activists complaining about the issue of child
                  labor, and Nike later accepted that some of the soccer balls
                  that Nike bought from Pakistan had been made by a contractor
                  who was using child labor. Although the issue of Nike using
                  subcontractors who are using child labor came into public in
                  1996, it may have started earlier because Nike has always used
                  the third world countries to produce its commodities and to
                  leave when the living standards of the country rise and make
                  the manufacturing more expensive. A good example is Japan
                  where Nike used to produce its commodities and later left when
                  Japan’s living standards went high. The case of the 12year old
                  boy stitching the soccer ball was just one of the many cases
                  which happen, and it shows that child labor is existent in
                  many developing countries. However, this does not mean that
                  the governments’ involved has allowed child labor but the
                  problem is that enforcement is weak. For instance, Pakistan
                  has laws concerning child labor, but in some places within the
                  country, some children work for 10hours a day, six days a week
                  simply because the law is not enforced by the government
                  (Schanberg, 2006).

                <span>
                  Semiotic Square is also called as Greimas square which is a
                  tool that is used for structural analysis. This also
                  identifies relationship between semiotic signs through
                  considering opposite sides of the concepts. Applying the model
                  in Nike, it can be said that the semiotic square is formed by
                  an binary relationship among two contrary signs. It basically
                  focuses on the study of signs and symbols which are the major
                  elements of communicative behaviour. At the same time, it also
                  includes identification of the system of communication such as
                  language, clothing and gestures. Another dimension is that it
                  depicts a general theory of signs and symbolism. This is
                  usually divided into the branches of pragmatics, semantics and
                  syntactics. There are three different aspects that lies in
                  this model and this can also be applied in Nike in terms of
                  showing the relationship between business aspects. Thus, on
                  the basis of above diagram, it can be said that Nike has to
                  implement ethical aspects in to business practices. However,
                  the practice of child labour increases ethical implications on
                  Nike and as a result it affects the business prospects. The
                  diagram depicts that child labour impacts Nike business
                  operations and at the same time it also increases legal
                  implications of the business. Therefore, with the elementary
                  structure, it is evident that the model shows relationship
                  between contrary, contradictory and implication. In this
                  context, it can be said that business marketing is mainly
                  focusing on the business interaction between organizational
                  actors. According to the Semiotic Square, Nike has to ensure
                  that all the business practices are ethically and legally
                  managed as that has a direct impact on business performance
                  and productivity aspects. In addition to the same, it can also
                  aid Nike to avoid all such aspects that can affect the
                  business practices. However, the model shall not be applied in
                  the situation if Nike already follows all ethical dimensions.
                  For instance- Nike can protect the business practices and
                  performance through acting ethically and at the same time it
                  does not require implementation of Semiotic Square in diverse
                  business aspects. Therefore, this context it is clear that
                  Nike needs to ensure that all legal and ethical dimensions are
                  being considered. In addition to the Semiotic Square, Nike is
                  also required to emphasize on ethical theories so as to apply
                  different principles which aids business entities to judge the
                  effectiveness of business practices
