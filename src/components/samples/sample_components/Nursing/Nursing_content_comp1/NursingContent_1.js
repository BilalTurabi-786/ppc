                It can be assessed that sun exposure and skin protection is
                considered as one of the major issue impacting upon the health
                of people especially the Australian farmers. Exposure from the
                sun causes skin damage and enhances the risk for developing skin
                cancer. However,&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;has reached to the highest
                rate in skin cancer disease globally (Jeffery, C. A and et. al.,
                2014). Also, it has been identified that farmers receives at
                least three times the UV exposure as compared to indoor workers.
                Thus, health care services have been increased in particular
                country and farmers are asked to wear a UV measuring device on
                their forehead during the whole European summer. Main effects to
                farmers of the sun exposure was between 12-4 pm when farmers
                carry out the activity such as mustering cattle and fixing
                fences.

                Skin protection is considered as one of the major issue
                impacting upon the health of Australian farmers and thus
                overcome such risk by adopting protective measures such as
                appropriate clothing and UV creams would helps in decreasing the
                risk of sun exposure. Thus, government also focusing upon
                promoting health campaign and thus protecting people living in
                rural and remote areas of Australia and overcome their health
                issue. In the global world, rural and agricultural population
                are known to be at high risk for skin cancer (Hegney, 2012).
                Thus, Australian farmers have been reaching a higher
                standardised mortality rate due to melanoma and other skin
                cancers. Further, there are certain factors that may increase
                the risk of skin cancer such as UV rays and thus reducing such
                risk may prevent individual from such diseases. Therefore,
                Australian farmers are provided better control measures in
                regard to protect themselves from UV and thus overcome risk
                factor of skin cancer. Hence, it can be stated that sun exposure
                causes harmful impact upon the health of Australian farmers
                (Sato, M and et. al., 2015).

                Care setting is focused upon delivering better care facilities
                to people living in rural and remote areas of Australia in
                regard to provide them proper care and support services so that
                they live healthy life. It is also essential for investigate the
                health issues within population i.e. Australian farmers
                regarding sun exposure and skin protection issues that impacts
                the health of farmers (Boehm, Franklin and King, 2014).
                Therefore, HSC plays as crucial role in providing care to
                farmers and inform them different ways of protecting themselves
                from the rays of sun so that it could not harm their skin.
                Following are the different risk factors for sun exposure such
                as Fair skin, Sunburns, Excessive sun exposure, Sunny or high
                altitude climates and Skin cancer.

                UV light is a major risk factor that affects an individual’s
                chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Through run rays
                skin cancer is caused and thus therefore nursing is remote areas
                needs to be provided properly so that farmers can be protected
                from UV radiation. Excess of sun exposure is harmful for skin
                and main work of farmers is carried out in day between 12-4 pm
                and thus sun rays affects them. Therefore, it is essential for
                rural and remote area nursing to provide proper treatment to
                farmers so that they can be safeguarded from radiation (Jeffery,
                C. A and et. al., 2014).

                Here, nurses play a significant role in delivering health care
                services to people in rural and remote areas of Australia so
                that farmers can be protected from prevailing health issue i.e.
                skin problems. Care home needs to give maximum care and support
                to Australian farmers living in rural and remote areas so that
                they can understand the ill effects of sun exposure and skin
                protection that impacts the health of farmers (Hegney, 2012).
                Proper health campaign needs to be launched so that information
                regarding health issues could be provided to people in regard to
                assess the risk factors for sun exposure within Australian
                farmer population and its impact on health outcomes.

                It shows the number of doctors and nurses working in remote and
                rural areas of Australia so that health needs of farmers could
                be fulfilled. These are not sufficient as it is not meeting the
                requirement which assesses that number of doctors and nurses
                needs to be increased that helps in providing better care
                facilities to farmers so that they can overcome their health
                issue (Abdoli and Abdoli, 2015).

                Sun damage among farmers is due to protonged exposure t solar
                radiation and is considered as serious problem for farmers.
                There are various risk factors that is significant for sun
                damage in farmers include long duration to exposure, wearing
                minimal clothing, white skin that burns easily etc. However,
                agricultural work also increases the risk of cancer mainly due
                to exposure of sunlight (Chuenkongkaew, W. L and et. al., 2016).
                Thus, rural and remote nurses and doctors are required to focus
                upon such health issue that helps in overcoming the risk in
                regard to deliver best care and support services to farmers.

                International&nbsp;<a>Accounting</a>&nbsp;standards have high
                level of importance which ensures high level transparency and
                standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final
                accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly
                reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making
                decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical
                knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting
                Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting
                personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and
                liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance,
                other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By
                taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel
                can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this,
                in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred
                tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to
                another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update
                with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager
                and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable
                tax liability.&nbsp;In addition to this, IAS 26 serves
                information about retirement plans which can be distinguished
                into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan.
                Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording,
                measurement and disclosure of information regarding the
                retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation
                accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and
                regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells,
                2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that
                technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for
                dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently.
                Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is
                highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail,
                Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has
                different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in
                against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is
                highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement
                benefits and deferred tax amount.&nbsp;There are several key
                issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated
                below:

                  Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the
                  regulations which business entity requires following for
                  ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However,
                  sometimes is not possible for the business organization to
                  comply with all the rules to the large extent.

                  Further, some government authorities have framed and
                  introduced legislation which entail that companies are not
                  obliged to prepare financial statements according to
                  accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives
                  also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow
                  for the preparation of financial statements.
