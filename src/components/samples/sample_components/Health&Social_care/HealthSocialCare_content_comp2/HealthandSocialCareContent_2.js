                Safeguarding is related to securing people’s health, prosperity
                and human rights(EURATOM and Renha Jr, 2010). Peoples are free
                from any type of harm and abuse by the persons and anyone else
                from the society. Disabled, children and older peoples needs
                safeguarding to reduce the harmful factors for them . This
                report is based on the Winterbourne View Hospital which is
                situated in Bristol. This is a private hospital which is working
                for mentally challenged and physically disabled peoples. In 2011
                a sting operation is conducted by the television broadcasting in
                the hospital which is having video about the reality of the
                hospital. Staff members are abusing their patients and beating
                them. These all are very serious type of issue for the hospital
                and as well as to Care Quality Commission which is a regulatory
                body on them. This report is having focus on the vulnerable
                groups which are abused by the social workers in the
                organisation. Most of the patients are grappling by this odd and
                irrespective conditions which are not appropriate according to
                the standards of the Care Quality Commission. In these types of
                conditions several risk factors can impact on the vulnerable
                groups.

                <strong>Abuse:</strong>&nbsp;Misuse of rights which are provided
                by the authorities is a type of abuse which makes a bad impact
                on the other person and on their civil rights(Whitmee and et.
                al., 2015). Each and every organisation provides some rights and
                responsibilities to a group of peoples to manage activities
                which is known as a&nbsp;management. So it is essential for them
                to use morale ethics to deliver their services in the favour of
                the clients.

            <p>
              <span>
                In this case social workers which are working to provide
                services to older age peoples, mentally disabled persons which
                are not able to perform their daily work. But the staff members
                which are appointed by the hospital for take care are performing
                against the moral ethics. They are torturing their patients and
                misbehaving with them, which is not appropriate according to the
                law and Care Quality Commission. Some types of abuses are here
                which is included in the case;
              </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Physical Harm:</strong>&nbsp;A person which is having
                power and strength to rule on the disabled and vulnerable
                persons can be misuse of their power and strength. In this case
                health care person is harming to their patients which are
                mentally challenged. This makes a direct negative impact on the
                human body and as well as on the mental level. So it is a type
                of criminally act which is never to be neglect by the higher
                authorities of the organisation(Davies and Ward, 2011).
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Drugs and Alcohol:</strong>&nbsp;This is an another type
                of the abuse where a sledgehammer person is ruling on the
                cobwebbed which appetite a care from the others. Focusing on the
                case study an authorized person abusing a mentally challenged
                weak patients and giving them extra harmful drugs. This is an
                act which is conducted by the wrong intention of the liable
                person.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Sexual:</strong>&nbsp;It is a type of harm which is
                influence on the human mental, physical and human behaviours.
                Sexual assault is a serious crime which would be never neglect
                by the regulatory bodies and authorized persons. Care Quality
                Commission has to make serious actions against the criminal act.
              </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Psychological Threats:</strong>&nbsp;This is a type of
                emotional, mental and as well as the physical which can be
                charged by the dominant persons on the vulnerable groups of the
                peoples(Yang, and et. al., 2015). So this act can be a cause of
                the psychological trauma and chronic depression for a patient.

                Some points are here which can explain for disabilities of
                vulnerable groups which a cause for them to afford such types of
                abusive situations. Some points are here to explain;
              </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Mental disabilities:</strong>&nbsp;In the Winterbourne
                View Hospital case, many type of patients are leaving here which
                is having a need of special care for mental relief and peace.
                These peoples are having mental disorders which has reduced
                their mental power to understand and analyse the conditions and
                peoples behaviours so this is a cause for them to be in such
                kind of pathetic situations. Older peoples which are living in
                this hospital are also having mental disorders to analyse the
                situations. Lack of mental power to understand human nature and
                human behaviours are making a compulsion for the older peoples
                and as well as to the mentally challenged patients.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Physical disabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Some peoples are
                having physical disabilities to perform their daily routine work
                so they are having a need to support of their relatives and
                friends(Parton, 2011). In this case social health care persons
                are Winterbourne View hospital is also providing care to the
                needy peoples. They are having some home care centres where
                disabled persons can live with a homely feel. But in this case
                study, social care person are misbehaving with them and abusing
                them. Most of the peoples are old, mentally challenged and
                physically disabled in the hospital, so they are target for the
                carer to reduce their outburst of their personal and
                professional life. Patients are disable to resist for these
                types of act so they are an easy target for the medical health
                care persons.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Understanding disabilities:&nbsp;</strong>These people
                of group is having less understanding abilities to analyse what
                types of behaviours peoples are doing with them(Sørensen and
                Syljuåsen, 2012). In this case study, a person is beating to the
                patients and other patients are laughing on them and no one is
                helping to them. So this is a cause for vulnerability to
                understand what’s going on with them and what kind of effect can
                be on them.
              </span>

            <p>
              <span>
                <strong>Thinking disabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Most of the
                disabled are having lack thinking abilities to judge in between
                right and wrong so they are vulnerable. Mental care can increase
                and resolve the mental disabilities of the patients so
                organisations like; Winterbourne View hospital has to support
                their patients and as well as they have to increase their strict
                instructions on the carer to follow in the hospital to maintain
                a standard according to Care Quality Commission.

                  the incidents of abuse and harm. As through education people
                  get aware of basic rights of each other and they start valuing
                  life of others as well. Education among people can be used as
