                In today’s scenario, social media is considered to be one of the
                top-notch computer mediated tool which are used by people and
                companies to share information, videos, ideas and pictures in
                virtual world by the help of internet network. Social media are
                different from industrial media in various forms which includes
                quality, reach, usability, immediacy, etc (Patino, Pitta and
                Quinones, 2012). Along with this, it has many forms of
                technologies such as blogs, business networks, social networks,
                social gaming, forums, etc which helps organisations in
                interacting with customers and fulfilling their demands by
                providing them information about company’s services and
                products. They can get information regarding offline users by
                using mobile social media applications. Companies get all
                details of customers related to their activities on their sites
                such as exact time of user when he open site, enter an outlet,
                close site and other activities doe by him during access of site
                (O’Keeffe and Clarke-Pearson,&nbsp; 2011). These technologies
                provide firms opportunities to develop strong and loyal
                relations with customers, to promote and advertise their
                products in better way, etc. There are different social media
                monitoring tools available in market which helps organisations
                in searching, tracking and analysing the conversations takes
                place on web related to their products, brands, services and
                other topics of interest. This information helps organisations
                in analysing their market positions, customers review towards
                their services or products etc. People are preferring social
                media for getting news rather than reading newspapers or
                watching televisions. According to a study it is found that
                three-fourth people get news from e-mail or social media sites.
                Social media has changed the world in such a fast speed that
                people could never have thought before. It is being used by
                people and companies to shape world’s culture and other
                features. It has accelerated the rate of information sharing,
                relation developing and influencing individuals (Gerbaudo,
                2012). Social media has got many features. It is only account of
                the mentioned features that these can be applied anywhere and to
                a given type of user interface. The first features the presence
                of a simple interface. It is on account of using colour scheme
                and graphics that is quite simple (Patino, Pitta and Quinones,
                2012). The colour usually used in this context id few and has a
                presence of slight monochromatic variations. In the same way,
                there is also a feature of Good search functionality which is a
                must on account of vastly available information on the net.
                However it is also true that search options have got a presence
                of multiple dimensions in terms of traditional content search,
                social applications. Some of the social media have further got
                buttons and links that should be placed on every page. The links
                are crucial so as to navigate to other areas (O’Keeffe and
                Clarke-Pearson, 2011). On the other hand, it may further let the
                user adjust with a specific application functions. In the same
                way social media further allows for providing a meaningful
                organization and presentation of information so as to make the
                content readable. It can further ensure that users are able to
                properly scan as well as perceive the content in the best
                possible manner. In the same way, a good social media site is
                the one that treat text as a form of content. In this regard,
                the content can be regarded as a huge text block which has an
                incorporation of subtle variations of text colour, font size as
                well as background. In the same manner, the links to
                presentation further makes sure that the user is able to have
                content more accessible. Other than this, web forms as well as
                site can be regarded as one of the most crucial element of
                social media. These have been used in everything starting from
                sign up to search, posting a reply as well as adding some
                content.
